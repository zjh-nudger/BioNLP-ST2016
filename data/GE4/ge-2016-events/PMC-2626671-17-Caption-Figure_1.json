(A) Kinetics of Prf1, Gzmb, Tbx21 (T-bet), and Eomes mRNA expression in differentiating P14 CD8+ T cells analyzed by Northern blotting. RNA from day 7 Th1 cells was used as a control. Sizes of mRNA transcripts are indicated. (B) Quantification of relative mRNA amounts by phosphorimager analysis. (C) Kinetics of protein expression in differentiating P14 CD8+ T cells analyzed by immunoblotting. Sizes of protein bands are indicated. (D) Relative protein amounts quantified from the Western blots. (E) Intracellular staining for granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF. Granzyme B staining was specific relative to an isotype control (not depicted). Cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. (F) FACS-based assay to measure cytolytic activity of P14 CD8+ T cells against EL4 targets loaded with 0 (\u2212) or 1 (+) \u03bcM Gp33 peptide (effector-to-target ratio = 5:1). Percentage of Annexin V+ (apoptotic) target cells in the CD8-negative EL4 target population (dot plots) was determined (histograms). Cytolytic activity was blocked by incubation with 2 mM EGTA (not depicted), confirming involvement of the granule exocytosis (perforin\u2013granzyme B) pathway. Data are representative of at least five (A\u2013E) or three (F) independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":80,"end":84},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":86,"end":90},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":92,"end":97},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":99,"end":104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":117,"end":132},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":117,"end":132},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":117,"end":132},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":117,"end":132},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":419,"end":422},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":580,"end":588},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":580,"end":588},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":580,"end":588},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":593,"end":603},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":605,"end":610},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":616,"end":619},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":621,"end":631},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":632,"end":640},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":815,"end":818},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":939,"end":948},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":982,"end":985},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1184,"end":1192},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1203},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E8"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M6","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E6"},{"id":"M7","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M8","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E8"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
