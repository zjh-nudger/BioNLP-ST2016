PBMCs were isolated as previously described (53). Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2\u2009mM l-glutamine (Lonza Cologne AG, Germany). HeLa, p50\u2212/\u2212p65\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and 293T were transfected with DNA by using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol; total DNA amounts were equalized by transfection of pRc/CMV empty vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For pulse-stimulation, HeLa cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) (20\u2009ng/ml) for 5\u2009min, or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1; Sigma-Aldrich) (20\u2009ng/ml) for 30\u2009min, washed twice in complete culture medium and then returned to culture. For luciferase assays, pSV-\u03b2-Gal was co-transfected with p\u03baBluc to monitor the transfection efficiency. Forty-eight-hour post-transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer of Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix, Bedford, MA, USA) and the luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities were evaluated by using Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix) in a bioluminometer (Turner Biosystem, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to \u03b2-galactosidase activity was expressed as relative light units.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":36,"end":46},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":59,"end":62},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":65,"end":68},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":453,"end":456},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":459,"end":462},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":866,"end":889},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":891,"end":896},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1020},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1038},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1203},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1246,"end":1256},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1261,"end":1276},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1431,"end":1441},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1454,"end":1469},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
