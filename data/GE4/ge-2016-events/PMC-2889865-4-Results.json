The results showed that NAI selectively down-regulated NF-\u03baB activation (figures 4a and 4b) and did not alter AP-1 activity (figures 4c and 4d). Exposure of Jurkat T-cells to NAI resulted in a modest reduction of CXCL8 following PMA exposure, while it did not alter the CXCL8 release following HK E. coli exposure (figure 5a). NAI did not affect TNF expression (figure 5b) indicating that NF-\u03baB is not the main regulator of CXCL8 or TNF following either PMA or HK E. coli exposure in Jurkat T-cells. In contrast, NAI resulted in a complete inhibition of IL-6 following PMA exposure and a 45% inhibition following HK E. coli exposure (figure 5c), suggesting an involvement of NF-\u03baB in IL-6 regulation.\nCa2+ was observed to increase AP-1 activity (figure 1c) and reduce NF-\u03baB activity (figure 2e); therefore, we exposed T-cells to a PKC inhibitor together with PMA to determine its effect on cytokine expression. Inhibition of PKC reduced CXCL8 release from 7 ng/ml to 3 ng/ml while it had a modest effect on IL-6 and TNF (figure 6a-c). This prompted us to test the effect of JNK inhibition on PMA-induced cytokine expression. JNK is involved in the regulation of a multitude of different transcription factors, including the phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun, c-Fos and p53, leading to cellular apoptosis [26]. Inhibition of the JNK pathways resulted in a down-regulation of both CXCL8 and IL-6, while no clear effect was observed on TNF expression (figure 6a-c). Analysis of mRNA levels using RT-qPCR (table 2) showed that PMA induced both il-6 and cxcl8 mRNA (5.1-fold and 111.8 fold respectively). Addition of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor NAI and the JNK inhibitor reduced the il-6 expression below basal levels. In contrast, while the cxcl8 levels were suppressed by the same treatments the levels remained elevated above basal level.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":385,"end":394},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":398,"end":403},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":404,"end":413},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":445,"end":450},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":455,"end":460},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":461,"end":468},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":469,"end":478},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":596,"end":605},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":609,"end":614},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":622,"end":631},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":725,"end":735},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":739,"end":743},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":744,"end":753},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":777,"end":787},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":788,"end":797},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":845,"end":856},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":869,"end":873},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":874,"end":884},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1114,"end":1121},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1122,"end":1127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1135},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1182,"end":1188},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1192,"end":1196},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1409,"end":1424},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1409,"end":1424},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1409,"end":1424},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1429,"end":1439},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1429,"end":1439},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1429,"end":1439},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1443,"end":1448},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1450,"end":1455},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1460,"end":1463},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1532,"end":1540},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1532,"end":1540},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1546,"end":1561},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1546,"end":1561},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1570,"end":1575},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1580,"end":1584},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1718,"end":1725},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1718,"end":1725},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1735},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1740,"end":1745},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":1746,"end":1750},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1746,"end":1750},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1856},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1861,"end":1865},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":1866,"end":1876},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1920,"end":1925},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":1926,"end":1932},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":1938,"end":1948},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E35","span":{"begin":1983,"end":1991},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E36","span":{"begin":1992,"end":2000},"obj":"Positive_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E24","obj":"E23"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E24"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E26","obj":"E25"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E26"},{"id":"R29","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E28","obj":"E27"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E28"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E30","obj":"E29"},{"id":"R32","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E30"},{"id":"R33","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E32","obj":"E31"},{"id":"R34","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E32"},{"id":"R35","p
