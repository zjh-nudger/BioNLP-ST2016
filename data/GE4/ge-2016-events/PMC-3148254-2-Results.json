Similar results were obtained with mouse splenocytes, indicating that the interaction of CD40 with HOIP is not limited to transformed B cell lines (unpublished observations). We also found that the recruitment of HOIP to CD40 was TRAF2-dependent and that overexpression of a truncated HOIP mutant partially inhibited CD40-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. These results support the hypothesis that HOIP plays a role in CD40 signal transduction. To further define the role and evaluate the importance of HOIP in CD40 signaling, we used somatic cell gene targeting to disrupt the gene encoding HOIP in the mouse B cell line A20.2J. This cell line has been particularly useful in the characterization of CD40 signaling mechanisms due to the relative ease with which its genome can be modified by homologous recombination [7], [8], [9]. We used a targeting vector capable of undergoing homologous recombination with Rnf31 (the gene encoding HOIP) to disrupt the coding sequence of the gene in exon 5 (Fig. 1A). Following introduction of the vector, the neomycin-resistant clones that arose were screened by PCR amplification of genomic DNA to identify cells containing a disrupted Rnf31 allele. To remove the selectable marker gene cassette from the disrupted Rnf31 allele, recombinant cell lines were transiently transfected with a plasmid that encodes Cre recombinase. This step allowed us to perform a second round of targeting and drug selection, generating cells in which both copies of Rnf31 were disrupted. Two independent clonal cell lines were chosen for further analysis. HOIP protein expression was undetectable in both cell lines, as determined by Western blot analysis of cell lysates (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the targeting process was successful. In the text that follows, the two gene-targeted cell lines are referred to as HOIP-deficient cells.\nTo enable us to confirm that any signaling or functional defects observed in HOIP-deficient cells were due to disruption of the Rnf31 gene, both HOIP-deficient cell lines were transduced with a retrovirus encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type HOIP, thus restoring HOIP protein expression (Fig. 1B). These cells are referred to as HOIP-reconstituted cells. In the experiments that follow, responses by these cells were compared to those of A20.2J cells and HOIP-deficient cells transduced with a retroviral vector (pMIP) lacking a cDNA insert (empty vector).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":19,"end":28},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":50,"end":60},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":64,"end":69},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":89,"end":93},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":138,"end":142},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":146,"end":155},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":291,"end":302},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":306,"end":310},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":316,"end":320},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":415,"end":426},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":430,"end":434},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":438,"end":442},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":447,"end":452},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":453,"end":462},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":502,"end":506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":534,"end":538},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":608,"end":612},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":629,"end":633},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":713,"end":717},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":721,"end":725},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":776,"end":783},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":802,"end":806},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":911,"end":915},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1122,"end":1127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1147,"end":1151},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1386},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1387,"end":1392},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1456,"end":1465},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1466,"end":1471},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1560,"end":1575},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1698,"end":1703},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1709,"end":1718},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1788,"end":1792},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1801,"end":1811},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2050,"end":2054},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":2055,"end":2064},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2149,"end":2153},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":2154,"end":2163},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":2182,"end":2192},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2200,"end":2205},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2217,"end":2221},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":2222,"end":2231},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2308,"end":2312},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":2319,"end":2328},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2329,"end":2333},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":2342,"end":2352},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2395,"end":2399},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":2400,"end":2413},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2521,"end":2525},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":2526,"end":2535},"obj":"Negative_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T27","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T19","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T30","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T31","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T32","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E5"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E11"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E11"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
