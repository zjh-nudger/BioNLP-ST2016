Mechanisms underlying the NF-\u03baB deregulation by HIV-1 are relevant for immune dysfunction in AIDS. We report that in single round HIV-1 infection, or single-pulse PMA stimulation, the HIV-1 Tat transactivator activated NF-\u03baB by hijacking the inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 and by preventing the repressor binding to the NF-\u03baB complex. Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB and increased the p65 DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity. The arginine- and cysteine-rich domains of Tat were required for I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF-\u03baB activity. Among an array of NF-\u03baB-responsive genes, Tat mostly activated the MIP-1\u03b1 expression in a p65-dependent manner, and bound to the MIP-1\u03b1 NF-\u03baB enhancer thus promoting the recruitment of p65 with displacement of I\u03baB-\u03b1; similar findings were obtained for the NF-\u03baB-responsive genes CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2. Our results support a novel mechanism of NF-\u03baB activation via physical interaction of Tat with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV-1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":34},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":64,"end":75},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":81,"end":86},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":91,"end":94},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":428,"end":431},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":466,"end":475},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":490,"end":495},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":503,"end":513},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":528,"end":535},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":572,"end":582},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":592,"end":595},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":617,"end":626},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":631,"end":634},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":639,"end":646},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":729,"end":732},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":738,"end":746},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":738,"end":746},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":751,"end":756},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":761,"end":764},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":765,"end":776},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":855,"end":865},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":873,"end":876},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":884,"end":893},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":898,"end":904},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":905,"end":915},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":921,"end":924},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":925,"end":934},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":947,"end":952},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":960,"end":966},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":967,"end":981},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":987,"end":996},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":987,"end":996},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1001,"end":1012},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1019},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1025,"end":1037},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1046},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1119},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1121,"end":1127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1136},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1209,"end":1220},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1227},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1233,"end":1238},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1246},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R21","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R23","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T40","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R27","pred":"partOf","subj":"T40","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R29","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T40","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R32","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E19","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R33","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R34","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R35","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R36","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R37","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E19"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
