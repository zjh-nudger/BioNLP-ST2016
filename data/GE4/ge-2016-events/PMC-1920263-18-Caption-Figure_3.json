(A) A3G promoter 5\u2032 deletion constructs of different sizes were cloned into pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmids. Numbering is relative to the major TSS. A putative Sp1/Sp3 consensus site (gray square) is depicted. (B) A3.01\u2009T cells were transiently transfected with the A3G promoter deletion constructs. Numbers on the x-axis refer to the length of the A3G promoter fragments in bp. (C) A3G promoter plasmids were transfected into U937, HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. Numbers in the legends refer to the length of the A3G promoter fragments in bp.\u2003After 48\u2009h, cells were harvested for luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities. Mean values (\u00b1SD) of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":11,"end":21},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":25,"end":28},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":29,"end":37},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":78,"end":81},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":161,"end":171},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":348,"end":351},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":431,"end":434},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":465,"end":468},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":592,"end":595},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":659,"end":669},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":685,"end":695},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":726,"end":737},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":726,"end":737},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":746,"end":756},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"partOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
