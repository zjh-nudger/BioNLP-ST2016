At 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, whole-cell lysates were obtained and subject to immunoblots with antibodies against proteins involved in NF-\u03baB, TBK1/IRF3, ERK1/2, and p38 signaling pathways. Beta-actin was used as loading control. (C) Cellular levels of p-IKK1/2 and p-I\u03baB\u03b1 in LPS- or poly I:C-stimulated BMDC were quantitated with ImageJ (NIH) and presented as trend lines. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":308,"end":312},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":313,"end":317},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":319,"end":323},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":324,"end":325},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":355,"end":365},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":420,"end":424},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":425,"end":426},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
