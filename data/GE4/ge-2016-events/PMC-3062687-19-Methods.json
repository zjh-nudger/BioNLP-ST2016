Briefly, cells were cotransfected at a ratio of 10:1 with various promoter-driven firefly luciferase constructs to the Renilla luciferase pTKRL plasmid, together with indicated plasmids. Cells were cultured for 1\u20132 days and then stimulated in triplicate before harvest. Lysates were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Kit (Promega).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":195,"end":205},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":232,"end":242},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
