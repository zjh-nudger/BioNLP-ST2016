A potential role of BMP-6 in the immune system has been implied by various studies of malignant and rheumatoid diseases. In the present study, we explored the role of BMP-6 in normal human peripheral blood B cells.\nResults\nThe B cells were found to express BMP type I and type II receptors and BMP-6 rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. Furthermore, Smad-phosphorylation was followed by upregulation of Id1 mRNA and Id1 protein, whereas Id2 and Id3 expression was not affected. Furthermore, we found that BMP-6 had an antiproliferative effect both in na\u00efve (CD19+CD27-) and memory B cells (CD19+CD27+) stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L. Additionally, BMP-6 induced cell death in activated memory B cells. Importantly, the antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in B-cells was completely neutralized by the natural antagonist, noggin. Furthermore, B cells were demonstrated to upregulate BMP-6 mRNA upon stimulation with anti-IgM.\nConclusion\nIn mature human B cells, BMP-6 inhibited cell growth, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 followed by an upregulation of Id1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":85,"end":97},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":101,"end":104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":165,"end":170},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":282,"end":287},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":429,"end":434},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":556,"end":561},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":570,"end":577},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":570,"end":577},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":570,"end":577},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":578,"end":593},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":578,"end":593},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":578,"end":593},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":597,"end":602},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":603,"end":604},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":605,"end":606},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":621,"end":625},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":626,"end":641},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":646,"end":654},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":646,"end":654},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":658,"end":670},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":658,"end":670},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":674,"end":677},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":687,"end":690},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":708,"end":711},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":716,"end":719},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":720,"end":730},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":720,"end":730},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":739,"end":747},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":739,"end":747},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":776,"end":781},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":829,"end":833},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":834,"end":838},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":861,"end":865},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":943,"end":948},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":964,"end":969},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1063,"end":1068},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1134,"end":1140},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1184,"end":1194},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1195,"end":1200},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1274,"end":1279},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1322},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1322},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1322},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1338},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1338},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1338},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1342,"end":1347},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1348,"end":1349},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1350,"end":1351},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1352,"end":1360},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1352,"end":1360},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1352,"end":1360},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1367,"end":1379},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1383,"end":1386},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R21","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R23","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E19","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R26","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E21","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R29","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R3","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"
