Promoter methylation of CpG target sites or direct deletions/insertions of genes are mechanisms of a reversible or permanent silencing of gene expression, respectively. Therefore, we investigated whether IRF-4 promoter methylation or mutation may be involved in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells. Whereas promoter mutations or structural rearrangements could be excluded as a cause of altered IRF-4 expression in hematopoietic cells, the IRF-4 promoter methylation status was found to significantly influence IRF-4 transcription. First, treatment of IRF-4-negative lymphoid, myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation-inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase of IRF-4 mRNA and protein levels. Second, using a restriction-PCR-assay and bisulfite-sequencing we identified specifically methylated CpG sites in IRF-4-negative but not in IRF-4-positive cells. Third, we clearly determined promoter methylation as a mechanism for IRF-4 down-regulation via reporter gene assays, but did not detect an association of methylational status and mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases or methyl-CpG-binding proteins. Together, these data suggest CpG site-specific IRF-4 promoter methylation as a putative mechanism of down-regulated IRF-4 expression in leukemia.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":15},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":49},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":55,"end":65},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":158,"end":161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":162,"end":165},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":305,"end":317},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":367,"end":397},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":399,"end":404},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":720,"end":730},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":734,"end":739},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":740,"end":750},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":858,"end":865},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":866,"end":871},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":872,"end":882},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":911,"end":916},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":972,"end":981},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":982,"end":987},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":988,"end":1001},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1028},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1029,"end":1037},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1134,"end":1142},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1182,"end":1190},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1194,"end":1199},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1345,"end":1353},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1365,"end":1370},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1371,"end":1379},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1456,"end":1461},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1462,"end":1477},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1687,"end":1692},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1741,"end":1755},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1756,"end":1761},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1762,"end":1772},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R3","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E10"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E13"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E16"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
