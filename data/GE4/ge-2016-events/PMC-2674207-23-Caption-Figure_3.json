(B) Time course of the effect of FP (10\u22128 M) on phosphorylation of activated transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), a measure of p38 MAPK activity. (C) FP-induced inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is associated with the decrease of anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation\u2013induced serine phosphorylation (P-Ser) of GATA-3. For (A\u2013C), quantification of the densitometry data is also shown. Each bar represents mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to \u03b1CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) FP induced MKP-1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments and where appropriate expressed as means\u00b1SEM, *p<0.05. (E) FP induces MKP-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Results are representative of two independent experiments. All data except (E) were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":95,"end":105},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":120,"end":135},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":139,"end":145},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":146,"end":152},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":153,"end":168},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":379,"end":385},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":404,"end":419},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":423,"end":455},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":457,"end":462},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":567,"end":575},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":608,"end":615},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":616,"end":622},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":623,"end":638},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":650,"end":656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":886,"end":893},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":894,"end":899},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":924,"end":933},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1077,"end":1084},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1090},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1115},"obj":"Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"partOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"partOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
