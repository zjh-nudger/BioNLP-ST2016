A nonspecific siRNA (Qiagen) was used as control. HeLa cells were transfected with 150 or 300\u2009ng siRNA per 6-well, using the HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for reverse transfection of adherent cells in 6-well plates.\nForty-eight hours after transfection, HeLa cells were harvested for detection of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. Cells were washed in PBS, lysed in RIPA (25\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 137\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Glycerol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 2\u2009mM EDTA pH 8, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors) and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. After boiling with Laemmli\u2032s buffer, samples were subjected to SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were detected using \u03b1-Sp1(Pep2) antibody (sc-59, Santa Cruz) or \u03b1-Sp3(D-20) antibody (sc-644, Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with \u03b1-rabbit-HRP (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of tubulin, \u03b1-tubulin (B5-1-2, Sigma) and \u03b1-mouse-HRP (Amersham Biosciences) antibodies were used. Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":43,"end":46},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":51,"end":54},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":492,"end":501},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":492,"end":501},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":513,"end":516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":896,"end":899},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":904,"end":907},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":922,"end":930},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":922,"end":930},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":939,"end":942},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":983,"end":986},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1105,"end":1112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1123},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
