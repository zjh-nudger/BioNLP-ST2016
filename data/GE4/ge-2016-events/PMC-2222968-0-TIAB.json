FOXP3 is an essential transcription factor for natural, thymus-derived (nTreg) and inducible Treg (iTreg) commitment; however, the mechanisms regulating its expression are as yet unknown. We describe a mechanism controlling iTreg polarization, which is overruled by the Th2 differentiation pathway. We demonstrated that interleukin 4 (IL-4) present at the time of T cell priming inhibits FOXP3. This inhibitory mechanism was also confirmed in Th2 cells and in T cells of transgenic mice overexpressing GATA-3 in T cells, which are shown to be deficient in transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2\u2013mediated FOXP3 induction. This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of GATA3 to the FOXP3 promoter, which represses its transactivation process. Therefore, this study provides a new understanding of tolerance development, controlled by a type 2 immune response. IL-4 treatment in mice reduces iTreg cell frequency, highlighting that therapeutic approaches that target IL-4 or GATA3 might provide new preventive strategies facilitating tolerance induction particularly in Th2-mediated diseases, such as allergy.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":27,"end":34},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":35,"end":41},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":42,"end":49},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":50,"end":55},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":56,"end":66},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":336,"end":341},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":478,"end":488},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":493,"end":503},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":656,"end":669},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":671,"end":675},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":715,"end":723},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":724,"end":729},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":823,"end":837},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":838,"end":844},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":879,"end":888},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":892,"end":926},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":927,"end":935},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":936,"end":941},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":942,"end":951},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":972,"end":980},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":991,"end":998},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1002,"end":1007},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1015,"end":1020},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1029},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1197},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1292,"end":1298},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1292,"end":1298},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1299,"end":1303},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1307,"end":1312},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R19","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T30","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R22","pred":"partOf","subj":"T30","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R4","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
