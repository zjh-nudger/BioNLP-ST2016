The cells were transfected for 18-24 hours, serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 \u00b5M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 100 ng/ml of M-CSF for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. (B) NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP along with empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-\u03baB p65 WT, NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A, or NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A. The cells were cultured for 24 hours and then serum starved for 4 hours. Cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are fold change over empty vector + pTAL-SEAP. (C) NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP with either empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-\u03baB p65 WT or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A. The cells were transfected for 24 hours and serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 \u00b5M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNF\u03b1. The supernatant were collected after 2 hours of treatment and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are the fold change over empty vector + pNF-\u03baB-SEAP. Data shown are mean \u00b1 S.E.M for at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":9},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":100,"end":111},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":100,"end":111},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":186,"end":189},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":202,"end":205},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":381,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":456,"end":459},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":489,"end":500},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":489,"end":500},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":489,"end":500},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":575,"end":578},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":589,"end":592},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":610,"end":613},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":876,"end":879},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":909,"end":920},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":909,"end":920},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":996,"end":999},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1015},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1194},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
