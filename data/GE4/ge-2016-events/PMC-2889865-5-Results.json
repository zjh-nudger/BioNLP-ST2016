Bcl10 is a signalling protein that acts upstream of NF-\u03baB in concert with CARMA1 and MALT1 and has been suggested to directly regulate NF-\u03baB activity in T-cells [27]. Therefore, Bcl10 activation was evaluated in both control and PMA stimulated cells after 10 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h using western blot analysis. The Bcl10 levels decreased following treatment with PMA, while in control cells, Bcl10 returned to higher levels by 24 h (figure 7c). This suggests that Bcl10 is involved in the PMA dependent inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":28,"end":37},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":38,"end":43},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":44,"end":55},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":228,"end":238},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":252,"end":257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":326,"end":332},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":337,"end":342},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":430,"end":435},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":436,"end":446},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":568,"end":573},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":581,"end":590},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":645,"end":650},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":651,"end":669},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":717,"end":722},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
