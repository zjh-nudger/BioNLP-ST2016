The cells were further centrifuged at 8000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C for 10 min and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Cytoplasmic proteins (~8 \u03bcg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by western blotting using anti-I\u03baB\u03b2, phospho-PKC (pan)(\u03b6 Thr410)(190D10), anti-Bcl10 (Cell Signalling Technology, Boston) and beta-actin (Abcam, Cambridge). Detection was performed following incubation with ECL\u2122 Anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase linked whole antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire) and developed using ECL\u2122 Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, UK).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":529,"end":539},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
