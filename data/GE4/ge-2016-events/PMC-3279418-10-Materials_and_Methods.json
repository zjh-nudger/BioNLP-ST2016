The primer sequences were forward, 5\u2032-CC ATG GCG ATG TCG CCG CCC GCC GGC GGT; reverse, 5\u2032- AAG CTT CTA GGT GGA AGC TGC AGC AAG A. The Sharpin cDNA was cloned into expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2. Murine fibroblasts and macrophages were were used to express recombinant SHARPIN protein. Cells (2\u00d7104) were seeded in 96-well treated plates the day before transfection. After overnight incubation, 200 ng pFLAG-SHARPIN plasmids were transfected with 0.5 ul Lipofectamine 2000. 24 hours later, cells were incubated with fresh culture medium. After another 24 hours, cells were lysed to confirm the FLAG-SHARPIN expression by immunoblots with anti-FLAG. Cells with no transfection and transfected with empty vector pFLAG-CMV-2 were used as negative control in all transfection experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":70,"end":77},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":270,"end":277},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":383,"end":390},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":403,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":542,"end":549},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":733,"end":740},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":741,"end":751},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
