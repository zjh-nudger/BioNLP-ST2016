Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (B) MDMs were pretreated with either vehicle or Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes before the addition of M-CSF for 10 minutes. Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 of NF-\u03baB p65 was detected using phospho-specific antibodies to either residue of NF-\u03baB p65. (C) Whole cell lysates of RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle control or Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presence of M-CSF were subjected to Western blot analysis with phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 NF-\u03baB p65 antibodies. (D) Cytosolic and nuclear fractions of RAW 264.7 were obtained from the treated cells and immunoblotted for phospho-NF-\u03baB. The purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting with GAPDH and Lamin B, respectively. Shown are representative blots from three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":36,"end":44},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":45,"end":49},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":50,"end":61},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":66,"end":75},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":80,"end":95},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":105,"end":108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":112,"end":118},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":235,"end":240},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":512,"end":517},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":583,"end":590},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":591,"end":597},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":601,"end":608},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":609,"end":615},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":625,"end":628},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":703,"end":706},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":800,"end":807},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":811,"end":819},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":823,"end":828},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"partOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"partOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"partOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T3"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E6"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
