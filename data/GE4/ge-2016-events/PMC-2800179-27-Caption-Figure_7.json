Cells were then treated with various concentrations of 10 kDa (triangles), or 40 kDa dCGN (squares). B: THP-1 cells treated with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) were lysed after various periods of time. Proteins in cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted for I\u03baB\u03b1 or \u03b1\u2212tubulin as loading control. C: Degraded carrageenans (dCGN) induced activation of NF-\u03baB. THP-1 cells were treated with nothing (control), or with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Nuclei were isolated and lysed. Proteins in nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted for NF-\u03baB p50 subunit (p50) or NF-\u03baB p65 subunit (p65). Lower panels show Western blots of nuclear ERK revealing equivalent amount of protein in each sample. Data are representative of three separate experiments. D: Degraded carrageenan (dCGN) induced activation of NF-\u03baB. Nuclei isolated from THP-1 cells were fluorescence-stained for NF-\u03baB p50 subunit or NF-\u03baB p65 subunit before (filled area) or after cells were treated with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Dashed line corresponds to nuclei stained only with secondary fluorescence antibody. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by flow cytometry as described.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":117,"end":124},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":125,"end":135},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":139,"end":149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":470,"end":474},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":839,"end":842},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":852,"end":855},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":866,"end":869},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":879,"end":882},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1171,"end":1174},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1192,"end":1195},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
