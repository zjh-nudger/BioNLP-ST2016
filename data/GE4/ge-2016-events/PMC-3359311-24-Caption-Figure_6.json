Cell culture supernatants were assayed for (A) NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity, (B) IL-8, and (C) IL-1\u03b2 secretion (n\u200a=\u200a3\u20136 experiments). Using the same stimulation method, THP-1 reporter cells were treated with Bay11-7082 (20 \u00b5M) for 1 hour prior to priming with heat-killed PAO1 or live PAO1. Supernatants were assayed at 24 hours for (D) NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity, (E) IL-8, and (F) IL-1\u03b2 secretion (n\u200a=\u200a3\u20135). PBMCs from CF patients (n\u200a=\u200a11\u201315) and controls (n\u200a=\u200a10\u201313) were treated with z-YVAD-fmk (20 \u00b5M) or Bay11-7082 (10 \u00b5M) and stimulated with live PAO1 (MOI\u200a=\u200a1), ATP (5 mM), or Poly(dA:dT) (1 \u00b5g/ml) according to the schedule in Figure 1. (G) IL-1\u03b2 and (H) IL-8 levels were measured at 24 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using two way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. *, **, and *** signify P<0.05, 0.01, and 0.001.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":17,"end":28},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":17,"end":28},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":43,"end":48},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":49,"end":59},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":64,"end":73},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":74,"end":78},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":74,"end":78},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":381,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":387,"end":396},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":662,"end":667},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":668,"end":677},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":929,"end":934},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E8"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E8"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
