Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA was more potent than HK E. coli at elevating the CXCL8 levels. PMA induced AP-1 activation and down-regulated NF-\u03baB while HK E. coli up-regulated NF-\u03baB without affecting AP-1 activity. In addition, the temporal induction pattern of AP-1 correlated to the release of CXCL8 while IL-6 followed the NF-\u03baB activity. Likewise, blocking NF-\u03baB activation resulted in a complete inhibition of IL-6 while the CXCL8 levels remained elevated as shown both at the protein and mRNA level. Furthermore, the CXCL8 release was down-regulated by inhibition of JNK activity. The present study indicates that in Jurkat T-cells, IL-6 is regulated through NF-\u03baB while CXCL8 regulation is independent of NF-\u03baB and closely associated with AP-1 activation.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":26},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":27,"end":34},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":88,"end":93},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":94,"end":101},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":218,"end":227},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":232,"end":237},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":438,"end":445},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":449,"end":454},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":461,"end":465},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":531,"end":539},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":554,"end":564},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":568,"end":572},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":583,"end":588},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":596,"end":604},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":605,"end":613},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":676,"end":681},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":682,"end":689},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":694,"end":708},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":792,"end":796},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":800,"end":809},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":830,"end":835},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":836,"end":846},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":850,"end":861},"obj":"Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E13"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
