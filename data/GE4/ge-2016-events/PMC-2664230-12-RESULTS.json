The addition PTX to LPS-stimulated cells resulted in a reduction in TNF-\u03b1, similar to that observed in our previous experiments (529 pg/mL \u00b1 112 vs. 37 pg/mL \u00b1 10; P < 0.01). Pre-incubation of cells with H89 prior to LPS and PTX exposure did not result in any significant modulation of TNF-\u03b1 production when compared to that demonstrated with PTX alone (P = 0.2; Figure 5). These results suggest that downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 production by PTX in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells is, at least in part, PKA-independent.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":23,"end":33},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":34,"end":52},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":72,"end":76},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":91,"end":98},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":99,"end":113},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":117,"end":122},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":123,"end":133},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":312,"end":320},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":326,"end":335},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":517,"end":523},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":543,"end":553},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":557,"end":562},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":563,"end":573},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":672,"end":686},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":690,"end":695},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":696,"end":706},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":776,"end":787},"obj":"Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E10"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E15"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
