CD8+ T cells from Runx3\u2212/\u2212 mice on the ICR background were purified by positive selection (Miltenyi Biotec). All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities and used according to protocols approved by the Immune Disease Institute and the Harvard Medical School Animal Care and Use Committees. For stimulation, purified CD8+ T cells were cultured at 106 cells/ml (10 ml) in T25 flasks coated with 1 \u03bcg/ml each of anti-CD3 (clone 2C11) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51) by pretreatment with 300 \u03bcg/ml goat anti\u2013hamster IgG. After 48 h, cells were removed from the TCR stimulation and recultured at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 105 cells/ml in media supplemented with 100 U/ml rhIL-2. Every 24 h, viable cells were counted and readjusted to 5 \u00d7 105 cells/ml with fresh media containing the corresponding amount of rhIL-2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":47,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":76,"end":80},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":132,"end":137},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":275,"end":278},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":293,"end":298},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":616,"end":619},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":714,"end":717},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":740,"end":744},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1096,"end":1102},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
