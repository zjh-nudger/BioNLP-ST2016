Purified naive CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2) harboring a Foxp3-ires-GFP allele (Bettelli et al., 2006) were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, IL-2, and TGF-\u03b2. After 3 d, Foxp3+-GFP+ cells were sorted by flow cytometry and mixed with CFSE-labeled naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells at ratios of 1:4, 1:2, and 1:1. The cells were then incubated with inactivated splenocytes and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb for four more days. CD45.1+ cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution (Fig. 6 A). CbfbF/+ CD4-cre CD4+ T cells activated in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 showed a clear suppression of T cell proliferation that became even more apparent when an increased ratio of FOXP3+/CD25\u2212 cells was used (Fig. 6 B). The suppression was significantly reduced when cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice were used, demonstrating that TGF-\u03b2\u2013induced Runx complexes are important for the suppressive activity of Foxp3+ T reg cells (Fig. 6 B). As a control, CbfbF/+ CD4-cre CD4+ T cells activated in absence of TGF-\u03b2 were mixed with CFSE-labeled naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells. No suppression could be observed in all control groups without TGF-\u03b2 at all tested ratios (Fig. 6 C). The decreased suppression capacity of CbfbF/F CD4-cre iT reg cells was unlikely to be caused by decreased survival or proliferation. Foxp3+ and Foxp3\u2212 cells generated from both CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control cells all displayed similar proliferation rates and cell death as measured by CFSE dilution and annexin V staining, respectively (Fig. S7, A and B).\nIn addition, we tested the requirement of RUNX1 and RUNX3 for the development of the suppressive capacity in human iT reg cells. We isolated human naive CD4+ T cells and transfected them with a combination of RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA, or with a scrambled control siRNA. Cells were cultured under T reg conditions, and then mixed with CFSE-labeled autologous CD4+ T cells and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. Cells in which RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down showed markedly lower suppressive activity compared with control iT reg cells at a T reg/CD4+ T responder cell ratio of 1:20, but not when the T reg/CD4+ T responder cell ratio was increased to 1:5 (Fig. 6 D). These results demonstrate the important role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 not only for the induction of FOXP3, but also for the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells both in humans and in mice. The data suggest both quantity and quality of T reg cells are hampered. Reduced intrinsic suppressive capacity of iT reg cells was demonstrated in mice, because Foxp3-GFP+ cells were FACS sorted and same numbers of iT reg cells are included in control experiments. In the suppression experiment with human cells, reduced suppressive activity was caused by reduced FOXP3 expression in T cells by siRNA inhibition of RUNX1 and RUNX3.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":6,"end":11},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":17,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":75,"end":80},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":106,"end":110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":111,"end":120},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":121,"end":124},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":138,"end":146},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":147,"end":156},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":160,"end":165},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":194,"end":197},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":198,"end":200},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":210,"end":215},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":239,"end":244},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":336,"end":339},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":354,"end":358},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":362,"end":369},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":382,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":390,"end":397},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":404,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":424,"end":429},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":435,"end":438},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":509,"end":511},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":518,"end":522},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":528,"end":533},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":546,"end":551},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":553,"end":556},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":628,"end":634},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":636,"end":639},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":763,"end":766},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":791,"end":797},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":849,"end":853},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":857,"end":864},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":865,"end":868},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":907,"end":912},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1027},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1029,"end":1033},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1124},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1135},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1171,"end":1176},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1246,"end":1251},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1291,"end":1295},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1299,"end":1306},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1307,"end":1310},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1344,"end":1349},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1391},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1393,"end":1396},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":1468,"end":1473},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1545,"end":1549},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1553,"end":1560},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1645},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":1651,"end":1656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":1684,"end":1688},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":1692,"end":1699},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":1808,"end":1817},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":1903,"end":1908},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":1913,"end":1918},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":2014,"end":2017},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":2070,"end":2075},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":2080,"end":2085},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":2086,"end":2091},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":2086,"end":2091},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":2216,"end":2219},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":2254,"end":2257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":2278,"end":2283},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":2288,"end":2293},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":2299,"end":2311},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":2299,"end":2311},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":2401,"end":2404},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":2461,"end":2464},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":2552,"end":2561},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":2552,"end":2561},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":2570,"end":2575},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":2580,"end":2585},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":2603,"end":2612},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":2616,"end":2621},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":2866,"end":2875},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":306
