In addition, because of the number of conventional PKCs existing within mononuclear cells, pharmacological inhibitors of PKC family activation was used to determine the relationship of PKC activation to M-CSF-induced cellular survival. MDMs were transfected with the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter and then treated with the general PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220; the conventional PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor G\u00f6-6976; or the intracellular calcium blocker BAPTA/AM. Ro-31-8220 significantly suppressed M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 2A). In addition, G\u00f6-6976 and BAPTA/AM also blocked NF-\u03baB activity in M-CSF-treated MDMs. Trypan blue exclusion analysis did not indicate cell death suggesting that this suppression was not due to non-specific toxicity. These data indicate that M-CSF mediated NF-\u03baB activation through calcium-dependent conventional PKC activation.\nWe next investigated whether PKC inhibition affected NF-\u03baB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Similar to MDMs, PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976 and BAPTA/AM reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Figure 2B). To ensure that PKC specifically regulated NF-\u03baB p65 and not the closely related family member, c-Rel, we co-transfected c-Rel and NF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs into the Raw 264.7 cell line and measured NF-\u03baB activity in response to M-CSF. There was no increased NF-\u03baB activity in cells expressing c-Rel (Figure S1). These observations indicate that PKC functioned upstream of NF-\u03baB p65 in MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":154,"end":159},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":518,"end":523},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":681,"end":685},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":686,"end":687},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":688,"end":697},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":688,"end":697},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":790,"end":795},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":850,"end":855},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":940,"end":945},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1120},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1389,"end":1394},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":1515,"end":1524},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":1515,"end":1524},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1531,"end":1534},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1578,"end":1583},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1603,"end":1608},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1707,"end":1712},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1761,"end":1771},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1777},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1828,"end":1838},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1857,"end":1860},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
