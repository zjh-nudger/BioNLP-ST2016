Transduction of both HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) clones with a retrovirus encoding FLAG-HOIP reversed defective CD80 upregulation, while transduction with an empty vector (pMIP) did not. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":5,"end":13},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":19,"end":31},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":35,"end":44},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":48,"end":52},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":53,"end":62},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":193,"end":203},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":355,"end":359},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":360,"end":369},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":371,"end":375},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":419,"end":423},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":424,"end":432},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":433,"end":442},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":443,"end":447},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":448,"end":460},"obj":"Positive_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
