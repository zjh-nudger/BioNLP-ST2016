Wu (NCI, Bethesda) and U. Siebenlist (NIAID, Bethesda), respectively. The HA-I\u03baB\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 (K44A)-Flag plasmids were purchased from Addgene44, 45. The Flag-RPS3, GST-RPS3, HA-RPS3, VN-HA, NleH1-HA plasmids were described previously6, 9. The point mutants of RPS3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Kit (Stratagene) with primers forward 5\u2032-CTGCCTGACCACGTGGCCATTGTGGAACCCAAA-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-TTTGGGTTCCACAATGGCCACGTGGTCAGGCAG-3\u2032 for S209A. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":39},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":41,"end":57},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":63,"end":77},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":183,"end":190},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":195,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":260,"end":269},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":271,"end":279},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":281,"end":288},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":290,"end":295},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":297,"end":305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":367,"end":371},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
