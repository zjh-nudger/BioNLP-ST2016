Proteins were expressed in BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) and lysates were purified by Ni2+-chelate column chromatography. Both TAT-linked proteins were more than 95% pure, based on Coomassie blue staining of sodium disulfate acrylamide gels.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":15},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":76,"end":81},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":83,"end":90},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":95,"end":111},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"partOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
