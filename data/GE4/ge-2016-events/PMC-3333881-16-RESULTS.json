To detect the Tat protein, we produced HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R\u2212E\u2212 virions, which were used in single-round infection of U937, a human monocytic cell line. Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF-\u03baB activation following viral infection. The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3- to 12-h post-infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 6A).\nThe NF-\u03baB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat-negative cells (siRNA Tat), and increased at 12\u2009h only in Tat-positive cells (Figure 6B). Degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 was observed at 3-h post-infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of I\u03baB-\u03b1 at 12\u2009h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6C). Consistently, the IKK activity was induced at 3-h post-infection and turned off at 12\u2009h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6D). These results agreed with the kinetic of NF-\u03baB activation in single-round HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells (Figure 1), and further supported the requirement of viral expression to counteract the post-activation turn off of NF-\u03baB.\nIn HIV-1-infected U937 cells, the endogenous Tat was coimmunoprecipitated with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65 (Figure 6E), and activated the MIP-1\u03b1 expression in a p65-dependent manner, as shown by the lack of effect following RNA interference of Tat or p65 (Figure 6F). Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF-\u03baB enhancer of MIP-1\u03b1, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat (Figure 6G and H). Altogether these results indicated that in single round HIV-1 infection Tat associated with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65, and induced the p65-dependent activation of MIP-1\u03b1 expression through occupancy of the MIP-1\u03b1 promoter and increased recruitment of p65.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":64,"end":72},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":77,"end":92},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":93,"end":103},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":107,"end":113},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":114,"end":116},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":117,"end":128},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":134,"end":139},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":144,"end":147},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":173,"end":176},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":177,"end":185},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":213,"end":223},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":227,"end":233},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":282,"end":285},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":312,"end":315},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":334,"end":342},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":465,"end":474},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":515,"end":523},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":532,"end":542},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":629,"end":639},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":629,"end":639},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":643,"end":646},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":718,"end":726},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":718,"end":726},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":730,"end":739},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":806,"end":809},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":814,"end":821},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":827,"end":834},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":865,"end":868},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":911,"end":914},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":931,"end":940},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":947,"end":956},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":973,"end":976},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1005,"end":1016},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1020,"end":1025},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1078},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1099},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1130},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1141},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1276},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1573,"end":1576},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1581,"end":1601},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1612},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1617,"end":1620},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1638,"end":1647},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1652,"end":1658},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1669},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1675,"end":1678},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1679,"end":1688},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1713,"end":1717},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1728,"end":1737},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1758,"end":1761},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1765,"end":1768},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1792,"end":1795},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1800,"end":1803},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1814,"end":1823},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":1831,"end":1845},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1855},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1867,"end":1870},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1871,"end":1880},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1885,"end":1894},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1898,"end":1907},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1999,"end":2002},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":2003,"end":2013},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2019,"end":2024},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2029,"end":2032},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":2038,"end":2045},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2050,"end":2053},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":2064,"end":2074},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2078,"end":2084},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":2085,"end":2095},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":2104,"end":2113},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":2121,"end":2127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T78","span":{"begin":2128,"end":2136},"obj":"Entity"},{"i
