To further examine this relationship, PBMCs from CF patients and healthy adult controls were stimulated with PAO1, LPS+ATP, and LPS+Poly(dA:dT), to activate the NLRC4, NLRP3, and AIM2 inflammasomes, respectively. By 24 hours of stimulation, CF PBMCs did not produce increased amounts of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5a) or IL-8 (Fig. 5b) when compared to healthy controls. However, we did notice a transient decrease (P<0.001) in the amount of IL-1\u03b2 produced by CF cells in response to LPS+ATP at 6 hours (data not shown). Stimulation of PBMCs with P. aeruginosa that lacks exsA (PAO1\u0394exsA), a key regulator of type III secretion, produced three-fold less IL-1\u03b2 compared to the parental PAO1 strain by 24 hours (Fig. 5a). Inflammasome stimulation without priming did not result in any IL-1\u03b2 production in either CF or control PBMCs. Contrary to our hypothesis, these results indicate that PBMCs from CF patients do not display increased production of IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 with inflammasome activation nor do they suggest any increased basal or induced NF-\u03baB activity. These results are consistent with our observation that caspase-1 activity is not different between CF and control PBMCs (Fig. 4).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":30,"end":37},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":38,"end":47},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":507,"end":514},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":515,"end":524},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":536,"end":541},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":640,"end":648},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":676,"end":681},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":682,"end":690},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":703,"end":717},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":863,"end":871},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":883,"end":887},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":888,"end":893},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1003,"end":1009},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1022},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1033},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1159,"end":1168},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1159,"end":1168},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1169,"end":1179},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1169,"end":1179},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1188},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1192,"end":1196},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E10"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E11"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Negation","obj":"E12"},{"id":"M6","pred":"Negation","obj":"E14"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
