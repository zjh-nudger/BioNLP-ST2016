A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, methylation of the IRF-4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells by 85.0% (Figure 5B). The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF-4-positive cells, since in vitro methylation led to a 92.9% abrogation of promoter activity in IRF-4-negative Jurkat cells (Figure 5C). In contrast, control methylation of a reporter construct with a different promoter (FasL) as well as an empty vector had no effect on the reporter activity (data not shown). These data proved a direct association between methylation and activity of the IRF-4 promoter.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":27,"end":32},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":151,"end":156},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":214,"end":219},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":450,"end":455},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":479,"end":488},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":510,"end":515},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":516,"end":524},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":620,"end":625},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":626,"end":634},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":684,"end":694},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":698,"end":706},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":719,"end":724},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":725,"end":733},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":844,"end":848},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1018},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"partOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"partOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E5"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
