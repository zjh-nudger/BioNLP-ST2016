After 1 and 2 hours, RNA was isolated with TRI-reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of Il6, Il12p40, Gmcsf, and Sharpin mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR. Primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Reverse transcription was performed at 42\u00b0C for 60 minutes with the final denaturation step at 90\u00b0C for 5 minutes in 30 \u00b5l containing 0.5 \u00b5g of total RNA. dNTPs, oligo(dT)15 primer, recombinant RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor, and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (all from Promega, Madison, WI) were used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reverse transcription was done in a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). qRT-PCR was performed in ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System with TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for mouse Actb, IL6, IL12p40, Ifn\u03b2, Gmcsf, and Sharpin according to the manufacturer's protocol. The endogenous standard for normalization of the target gene was \u03b2-actin. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method [56].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":275,"end":285},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":275,"end":285},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":275,"end":285},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":275,"end":285},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":289,"end":292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":294,"end":301},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":303,"end":308},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":314,"end":321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":642,"end":669},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1008},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1013},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1015,"end":1022},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1028},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1035},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1048},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1163},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
