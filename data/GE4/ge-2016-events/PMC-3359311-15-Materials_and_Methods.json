Cells were primed with LPS for 5 hours and stimulated with ATP for 1 hour or stimulated with live PAO1 for 3 hours. PBMCs were stimulated the same day as blood donation. PBMCs were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 4.5\u00d7105 cells/well (2.5\u00d7106 cells/ml), primed with LPS for 5 hours and then stimulated with ATP for 1 hour or Poly(dA:dT) for 3 hours or stimulated with live PAO1 for 3 hours. Caspase-1 activity was measured using FLICA (Immunochemistry Technologies), a cell-permeable fluorescent probe (FAM-YVAD-fmk) that binds active caspase-1. Cells were incubated 1 hour with FLICA at 37\u00b0C and stained with PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD14 antibodies (eBioscience) to identify monocytes. The gating strategy consisted of including live cells that were CD14 positive which were subsequently analyzed for the frequency of FLICA positive cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":882,"end":886},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
