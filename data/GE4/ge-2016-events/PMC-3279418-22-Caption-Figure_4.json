At 0, 1 and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the expression of Il12p40 (A,B), Il6 (C,D), Gmcsf (E,F), and Ifnb (G,H) mRNA. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SD. Data are representative of two independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":301,"end":311},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":301,"end":311},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":301,"end":311},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":301,"end":311},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":315,"end":322},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":330,"end":333},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":341,"end":346},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":358,"end":362},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
