For co-transfection studies, PKC\u03b1 or NF-\u03baB p65 constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5\u22361 with the reporter plasmid. For siRNA transfection, 100 nM of PKC\u03b1 siRNA or control siRNA were used. Cells were incubated with the transfection reagents for 16\u201324 hours, washed and starved in RPMI without FBS for 4 hours. Samples were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF for 4 hours at which point the medium was collected for the SEAP analysis. For inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes before M-CSF treatment. On average, we realized 30\u201340% transfection efficiency as confirmed by GFP expression in Raw 264.7 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":384,"end":399},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":384,"end":399},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":409,"end":413},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":423,"end":426},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":528,"end":538},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":732,"end":737},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":900,"end":905},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":988,"end":991},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":992,"end":1002},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
