Here, we demonstrate the absence of IRF-4 expression in various hematopoietic cell lines, such as Jurkat, a T-cell leukemia, CML-T1, a bcr-abl-positive T-cell line, K-562, a bcr-abl-positve erythroleukemia, U-937, a monocytic leukemia, EM-2 and LAMA-84, bcr-abl-positve myeloid leukemia, but not in SD-1, a bcr-abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre B-ALL), RPMI-8226, a multiple myeloma and BV-173, a bcr-abl-positive B-cell line (Figures 1A and 5D). After sequencing of the IRF-4 promoter, it could be excluded that absence of IRF-4 expression in any of the above cell lines was due to genetic aberrations. However, 2 bp changes (nucleotide \u22121081, T\u2192C and \u22121068, A\u2192C) could be detected in both the IRF-4-positive BV-173 and the IRF-4-negative LAMA-84, EM-2 and K-562 (Figure 1B). At position \u2212116 an A\u2192C substitution was found in EM-2, K-562 and CML-T1, whereas Jurkat, BV-173 and SD-1 exhibited a mixed A/C sequence and U-937, LAMA-84 and RPMI-8226 no substitution at all (Figure 1B). Consequently, these alterations are unlikely to affect IRF-4 expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":16},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":17,"end":27},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":53,"end":56},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":115,"end":119},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":123,"end":128},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":129,"end":139},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":234,"end":239},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":240,"end":250},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":333,"end":340},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":341,"end":349},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":372,"end":379},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":380,"end":387},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":452,"end":459},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":460,"end":467},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":505,"end":512},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":513,"end":521},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":608,"end":615},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":616,"end":624},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":682,"end":687},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":724,"end":731},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":735,"end":740},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":741,"end":751},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":906,"end":911},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":912,"end":920},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":936,"end":941},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":942,"end":950},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1242,"end":1248},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1249,"end":1254},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1255,"end":1265},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E6"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E15"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E16"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E16"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
