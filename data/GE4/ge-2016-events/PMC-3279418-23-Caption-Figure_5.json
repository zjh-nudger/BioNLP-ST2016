Unstained cells serve as negative controls. (B) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (1\u00d7105 cells in 0.1 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with medium, 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 \u00b5g/ml poly I:C for 24 hours. Supernatants were collected for ELISA of IL10. (C) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (5\u00d7105 cells in 0.2 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 \u00b5g/ml poly I:C. At 0, 1, and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the production of A20.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":7,"end":11},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":16,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":20,"end":30},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":20,"end":30},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":35,"end":44},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":35,"end":44},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":45,"end":49},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":50,"end":59},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":64,"end":67},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":68,"end":78},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":480,"end":484},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":708,"end":718},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":722,"end":725},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
