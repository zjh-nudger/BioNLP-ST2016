After ICS FACS, data were collected on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star). For ELISA, cells were similarly restimulated for 48 hr and supernatant was collected and analyzed for IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 as described before (Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":97,"end":100},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":120,"end":124},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":459,"end":463},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":465,"end":470},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":476,"end":481},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
