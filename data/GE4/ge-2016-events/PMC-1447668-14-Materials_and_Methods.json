Jurkat T cells were plated at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well in six-well culture plates the day of transfection with the appropriate plasmid DNA (~2 \u03bcg total) using FuGene 6 transfection reagent. Primary human CD4+ T cells (2 \u00d7 106) were nucleofected with the specified plasmid DNA (5 \u03bcg total) using the Human T Cell Nucleofection Kit (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States). Forskolin (10 \u03bcM; Calbiochem, San Diego, California, United States) was added in some experiments 20 h posttransfection. Cells were harvested 24 h posttransfection and luciferase activity was analyzed using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, California, United States) according to manufacturer's guidelines. pGL4-TKhRluc2 was used as an internal control to normalize for transfection efficiency. Nucleofected CD4+ T cells were also monitored for transfection efficiency and cell viability 24 h posttransfection as follows. Transfection efficiency was routinely ~30% as determined by flow cytometric analysis of EGFP expression. Cell viability, determined by staining with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD; BD Biosciences), was routinely ~70%. Both transfection efficiency and cell viability in nucleofected CD4+ T cells was independent of the plasmids used.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":25,"end":35},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":524,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":866,"end":876},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":914,"end":924},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1209},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1600,"end":1603},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
