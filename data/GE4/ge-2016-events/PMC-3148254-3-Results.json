To begin evaluating potential contributions of HOIP to CD40 signaling, we assayed the upregulation of CD80 induced by engagement of CD40 on parental A20.2J, HOIP-deficient, and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig. 2). Compared to the parental cell line, the CD40-stimulated upregulation of CD80 was dramatically reduced in all HOIP-deficient cells tested. In contrast, upregulation of CD80 was restored in HOIP-reconstituted cells, confirming that the defect in CD80 upregulation in the HOIP-deficient cells was due to the disruption of Rnf31.\nCD40 signals in B cells can also contribute to the activation of DNA recombination in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus [11], [12]. This process, known as immunoglobulin class switching (or isotype switching), allows B cells, initially expressing IgM, to switch to IgA, IgG, or IgE depending on the class of antibody most appropriate for a particular immune response. Switching to IgE can be induced by the combination of IL-4 and CD40 signals. The gene rearrangement necessary for IgE production is preceded by the production of non-coding RNA transcripts from germline sequences in the IgE heavy chain locus [13]. To determine whether HOIP is required in the initiation of the class switching process, the relevant B cell lines were stimulated through CD40 in the presence of IL-4 and tested for production of germline epsilon (GL\u03b5) transcripts (Fig. 3). Anti-CD40 antibody stimulation alone or together with IL-4 induced GL\u03b5 transcription in parental A20.2J cells as expected. In contrast, only low levels of GL\u03b5 expression were detected in HOIP-deficient cells stimulated with either anti-CD40 antibody alone or anti-CD40 and IL-4. Normal levels of GL\u03b5 expression were induced in HOIP-reconstituted cells stimulated with anti-CD40 antibody alone or together with IL-4. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HOIP has a critical role in cellular responses to CD40 signaling.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":8,"end":16},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":8,"end":16},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":25},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":26,"end":34},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":26,"end":34},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":40,"end":52},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":57,"end":67},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":71,"end":87},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":88,"end":101},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":102,"end":112},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":116,"end":120},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":132,"end":143},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":144,"end":154},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":158,"end":162},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":315,"end":319},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":323,"end":327},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":354,"end":366},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":370,"end":374},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":375,"end":382},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":386,"end":396},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":400,"end":404},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":425,"end":429},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":445,"end":449},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":450,"end":463},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":520,"end":524},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":525,"end":535},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":536,"end":548},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":552,"end":556},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":574,"end":581},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":589,"end":593},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":594,"end":603},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":631,"end":643},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":647,"end":651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":668,"end":672},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":673,"end":686},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":714,"end":720},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":724,"end":728},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":729,"end":741},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":749,"end":753},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":754,"end":763},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":774,"end":777},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":785,"end":795},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":799,"end":804},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1231,"end":1235},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1240,"end":1244},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1446,"end":1450},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1567},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1587,"end":1591},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1617},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1621,"end":1637},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1639,"end":1642},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1720,"end":1724},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1725,"end":1732},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1733,"end":1736},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1737,"end":1750},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1821,"end":1824},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1825,"end":1835},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1853,"end":1857},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":1858,"end":1867},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1939,"end":1943},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1962,"end":1965},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":1966,"end":1976},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":1982,"end":1989},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1993,"end":1997},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":1998,"end":2011},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2076,"end":2080},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2124,"end":2128},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2174,"end":2178},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T28","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6",
