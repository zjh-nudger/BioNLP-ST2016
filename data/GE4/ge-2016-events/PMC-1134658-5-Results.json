Type I receptors can signal via several pathways. We examined the effect of BMP-6 on Smad phosphorylation, as the activation of Smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for BMPs [17]. B cells were cultured in serum-free media over night and then treated with BMP-6 for various time points. Total protein lysates were prepared, and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of Smad1/5/8 were determined by western blot analysis. Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad. The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5). A similar phosphorylation was observed in Ramos cells, but not in HL60 cells (Figure 6). Furthermore, we also tested whether other known downstream signalling pathways of BMP-6 could be triggered by BMP-6 in human B cells. However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":6,"end":13},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":6,"end":13},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":6,"end":13},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":14,"end":29},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":14,"end":29},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":14,"end":29},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":39,"end":40},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":41,"end":42},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":216,"end":221},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":410,"end":415},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":501,"end":515},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":501,"end":515},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":501,"end":515},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":525,"end":530},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":531,"end":532},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":533,"end":534},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":617,"end":622},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":623,"end":630},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":623,"end":630},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":623,"end":630},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":631,"end":646},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":631,"end":646},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":631,"end":646},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":660,"end":665},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":674,"end":689},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":674,"end":689},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":674,"end":689},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":970,"end":975},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":998,"end":1003},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1073},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1073},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1097},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1114},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1118},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1129},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R18","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R21","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R24","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R27","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R29","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E19","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R30","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R32","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E21","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R33","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R34","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R35","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E23","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R36","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R37","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E23"},{"id":"R38","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E25","obj":"E24"},{"id":"R39","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E24"},{"id":"R40","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E25"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E3"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E8"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E9"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E22"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Negation","obj":"E24"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
