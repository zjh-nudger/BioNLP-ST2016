GATA-3 was excised from pOTB7 using XhoI digestion and pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was digested with BamHI. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the GATA-3 fragment and the pEGFP-C2 vector blunt-ended by incubation with Klenow (Bioline Bio-27029) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Klenow was inactivated by incubation for 10 min at 75\u00b0C. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the blunt-ended GATA-3 fragment and the GFP vector were subsequently digested with EcoRI before the 5\u2032-EcoRI/3\u2032\u2013blunt end GATA-3 fragment was inserted into the 5\u2032-EcoRI/3\u2032\u2013blunt ended GFP vector. Positive clones were confirmed by digestion and size analysis by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and by sequencing.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":7,"end":10},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":25,"end":31},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":143,"end":149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":171,"end":177},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":295,"end":300},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":381,"end":387},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":647,"end":653},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":671,"end":674},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":714,"end":719},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":753,"end":759},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":815,"end":818},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
