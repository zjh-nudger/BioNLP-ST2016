HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vectors of HA-p65 and FLAG-Tat, and 24\u2009h later Tat was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. The p65 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type Tat or the mutants Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49\u201357)A at similar levels, while a significant decrease in coimmunoprecipitation was observed for Tat C(22,25,27)A (Figure 4A). Consistently, GST-pull down of in vitro translated proteins showed the direct binding of p65 to wild-type Tat, or the mutants Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49\u201357)A, and lack of binding to Tat C(22,25,27)A (Figure 4B). These results indicated that Tat associated with p65 through the cysteine-rich domain and ruled-out the requirement of bridging proteins to mediate such interaction.\nTo identify the p65 domain required for binding to Tat, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Tat together with HA-p65 mutants, which were deleted of the transactivation domain [p65\u0394C (1\u2013318)], or the RHD [p65\u0394N (122\u2013551)] (Figure 4C). Tat coimmunoprecipitated with p65\u0394C (1\u2013318), and not with p65\u0394N (122\u2013551) (Figure 4D), indicating that the RHD of p65 was involved in the physical interaction with Tat.\nTo address the effect of Tat on the p65 DNA-binding affinity, purified recombinant p65 protein was incubated with 32P-labeled-NF-\u03baB double-stranded oligonucleotide in presence or absence of wild-type Tat or Tat C(22,25,27)A, and p65 DNA-binding was analysed by EMSA. Whereas wild-type Tat significantly increased the binding of p65 to DNA, the mutant Tat C(22,25,27)A, lacking the binding site for p65, was ineffective (Figure 4E). The p65 binding to DNA was evaluated by competition with increasing amounts of cold competitor NF-\u03baB oligonucleotide, which showed that Tat significantly enhanced the p65 affinity binding to DNA (Figure 4E and F).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":4,"end":13},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":31,"end":38},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":54,"end":65},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":71,"end":74},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":93,"end":96},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":108,"end":118},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":124,"end":127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":188,"end":194},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":199,"end":207},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":224,"end":227},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":232,"end":250},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":275,"end":278},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":291,"end":311},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":327,"end":330},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":346,"end":361},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":363,"end":376},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":381,"end":394},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":434,"end":442},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":446,"end":467},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":485,"end":501},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":529,"end":532},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":593,"end":600},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":604,"end":607},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":621,"end":624},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":641,"end":656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":658,"end":671},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":676,"end":689},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":703,"end":710},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":714,"end":730},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":773,"end":776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":777,"end":787},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":793,"end":796},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":809,"end":829},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":884,"end":891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":926,"end":929},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":930,"end":936},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":937,"end":945},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":950,"end":957},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":961,"end":964},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":999,"end":1007},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1028},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1049,"end":1056},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1049,"end":1056},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1086},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1088,"end":1101},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":1111,"end":1114},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1146,"end":1149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1170},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1189},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1204,"end":1219},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":1253,"end":1256},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1260,"end":1263},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1293,"end":1304},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1310,"end":1313},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1336},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1340,"end":1343},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1351,"end":1354},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1359,"end":1366},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1401},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1515,"end":1518},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1522,"end":1538},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1544,"end":1547},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1552,"end":1559},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1600,"end":1603},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1618,"end":1627},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1632,"end":1639},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1643,"end":1646},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1666,"end":1682},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1684,"end":1691},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1696,"end":1703},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T80","span":{"begin":1704,"end":1708},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1713,"end":1716},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1722,"end":1733},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1751,"end":1754},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1755,"end":1762},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1883,"end":1886},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1901,"end":1909},"obj"
