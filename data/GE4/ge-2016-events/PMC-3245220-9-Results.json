{"target":"http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PMC/sourceid/3245220/divs/9","sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"3245220","divid":9,"text":"Identification of PKC\u03b1 as the Upstream Activator of NF-\u03baB in Myeloid Cells\nEven though the PKC family consists of 10 members, finding that PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitors and intracellular calcium inhibitors reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity, suggested PKC\u03b1 was involved in NF-\u03baB activation after M-CSF treatment. To confirm the role of PKC\u03b1 in NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages, constructs for either wildtype (WT)-PKC\u03b1 or kinase-deficient (KD)-PKC\u03b1 was co-transfected with the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter gene and SEAP secretion was measured. As shown in Figure 7A, MDMs co-transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP and WT-PKC\u03b1 had a 1.8-fold increase in NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared with NS cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.05), similar to M-CSF-treated cells expressing only pNF-\u03baB-SEAP. Transfecting human macrophages with the KD-PKC\u03b1 construct significantly reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity compared to WT-PKC\u03b1 transfected cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.016). Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells transfected with WT-PKC\u03b1 had 2.5-fold more NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared to unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells (NS) transfected with WT-PKC\u03b1 (Figure 7B). Expression of the KD-PKC\u03b1 construct into RAW 264.7 cells reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity to 1.5-fold (p\u200a=\u200a0.045) compared to cells transfected with WT PKC\u03b1.\nCell survival was also examined in MDMs expressing either WT-PKC\u03b1 or KD-PKC\u03b1 constructs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining. As expected, M-CSF increased MDM survival as measured by the percent of Annexin V/PI negative cells. Similarly, expression of WT-PKC\u03b1 protected cells from apoptosis. In contrast, expression of KD-PKC\u03b1 decreased M-CSF-induced cell survival (p<0.01) (Figure 7C).\nNext, we examined the effect of expressing the PKC\u03b1 constructs on NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKC\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-\u03baB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276. Expression of WT-PKC\u03b1 did not effect the phosphorylation of either residue with or without M-CSF stimulation. These observations demonstrate that PKC\u03b1 is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-\u03baB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65.\nTo further validate the impact that PKC\u03b1 played in M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKC\u03b1 siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells. A pool of specific PKC\u03b1 siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF. Reducing native PKC\u03b1 expression decreased M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in both MDM (Figure 7E) (p\u200a=\u200a0.012) and Raw 264.7 cells (Figure 7F) (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKC\u03b1 siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKC\u03b1 siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p\u200a=\u200a0.047). In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKC\u03b1 siRNA transfection decreased PKC\u03b1 protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that PKC\u03b1 regulated NF-\u03baB activation and M-CSF-regulated cell survival.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":139,"end":143},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":144,"end":145},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":146,"end":156},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":146,"end":156},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":202,"end":207},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":242,"end":246},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":286,"end":291},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":326,"end":330},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":403,"end":407},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":411,"end":427},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":442,"end":456},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":553,"end":567},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":592,"end":596},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":661,"end":666},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T82","span":{"begin":667,"end":677},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":724,"end":729},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":813,"end":815},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":853,"end":858},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":897,"end":901},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":902,"end":913},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":960,"end":971},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":980,"end":984},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1045},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T83","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1056},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1114},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1123,"end":1127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1159,"end":1161},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1162,"end":1166},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1277,"end":1288},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1297,"end":1301},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1343,"end":1353},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1368},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1372,"end":1374},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1375,"end":1379},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1394,"end":1403},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":1439,"end":1444},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1498,"end":1507},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1511,"end":1519},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1538,"end":1548},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1555,"end":1559},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1621},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1622,"end":1626},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":1637,"end":1642},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1719,"end":1729},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1734,"end":1738},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1813,"end":1815},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1816,"end":1820},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1848,"end":1854},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1872,"end":1887},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":1891,"end":1897},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1907,"end":1910},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1916,"end":1926},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1931,"end":1946},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":1950,"end":1956},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1958,"end":1968},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1975,"end":1979},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1988,"end":1994},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1988,"end":1994},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1999,"end":2014},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1999,"end":2014},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":2033,"end":2048},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":2033,"end":2048},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":2049,"end":2054},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2104,"end":2108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T76","span":{"begin":2125,"end":2130},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":2205,"end":2220},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":2224,"end":2230},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2240,"end":2243},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2281,"end":2285},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T77","span":{"begin":2296,"end":2301},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2359,"end":2369},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2420,"end":2430},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T84","span":{"begin":2483,"end":2491},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"i
