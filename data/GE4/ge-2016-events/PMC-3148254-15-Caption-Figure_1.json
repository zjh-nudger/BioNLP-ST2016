Arrows (F and R) indicate approximate positions of sequences homologous to oligonucleotides used for PCR-mediated detection of homologous recombination. Homologous recombination of the vector with Rnf31 resulted in a small chromosomal deletion and the in-frame insertion of neomycin phosphotransferase (NeoR) into the amino-terminal HOIP coding sequence. A diphtheria toxin (DT) cassette in the vector facilitates the negative selection of cells in which random chromosomal insertion of the vector takes place. LoxP sequences allow the Cre-mediated deletion of the NeoR coding sequence. The SV40pA sequence helps to ensure disruption of gene expression after deletion of the NeoR sequence. (B) Anti-HOIP and anti-FLAG Western blots of cell lysates from A20.2J cells and HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) clones. A partial decrease in HOIP protein expression is evident in cells following disruption of one copy of Rnf31 (HOIP\u2212/+). HOIP expression in clones reconstituted with an empty retroviral vector (pMIP) or a retroviral vector encoding FLAG-tagged HOIP is also shown. Approximate molecular weight of HOIP is 120 kD.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":36,"end":41},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":77,"end":81},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":454,"end":458},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":891,"end":895},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":896,"end":905},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":907,"end":911},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":934,"end":942},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":946,"end":950},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":959,"end":969},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":990,"end":999},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1010},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1026,"end":1031},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1037},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1047},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1058},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1166,"end":1170},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1218,"end":1222},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
