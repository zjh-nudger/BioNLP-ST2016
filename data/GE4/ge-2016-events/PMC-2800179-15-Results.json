Very low levels of TNF-\u03b1 were induced in PBM after stimulation with native CGN (Fig. 2A). Addition of 0.1 mg/ml 10 kDa dCGN resulted in approximately a 60-fold increase in TNF-\u03b1 production by PBM. This was a dose-dependent effect that reached a 180-fold increase when cells were exposed to 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (Fig. 2A). A 250-fold increase in TNF-\u03b1 production was detected at 1 mg/ml 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 2A). TNF-\u03b1 production increased in time reaching a maximum level at 8 hours of culture (Figure 2B). After 24 h, the amount of secreted TNF-\u03b1 was still one third of the total TNF-\u03b1. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known activator of immune cells also induced TNF-\u03b1 production with similar kinetics as dCGN (Fig. 2B). However, the amount of TNF-\u03b1 produced by LPS was 4-fold less than the one produced by dCGN and it was not detected after 8 hours of culture (Fig. 2B). Similarly, monocytic THP-1 cells cultivated in the presence of variable concentration of dCGN showed an increase in TNF-\u03b1 production (Fig. 2C). This increase in TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly smaller (about 10-fold) than the one presented by PBM (Fig. 2A). No TNF-\u03b1 was released from THP-1 cells exposed to native CGN (not shown). TNF-\u03b1 production by THP-1 cells was not dose dependent to the amount of dCGN used. Also there was no difference between the two forms (10 and 40 kDa) of dCGN (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 release from THP-1 cells stimulated with dCGN reached a maximum level at 32 h, while stimulation with LPS reached a maximum level at 56 h (Fig. 2D).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":13,"end":20},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":21,"end":26},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":27,"end":37},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":102,"end":111},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":112,"end":117},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":118,"end":128},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":234,"end":239},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":245,"end":252},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":266,"end":277},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":339,"end":347},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":375,"end":383},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":387,"end":392},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":393,"end":403},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":428,"end":437},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":550,"end":558},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":562,"end":567},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":568,"end":578},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":626,"end":631},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":632,"end":642},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":643,"end":652},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":747,"end":755},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":756,"end":761},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":795,"end":800},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":867,"end":874},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":875,"end":880},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":881,"end":891},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":956,"end":961},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":962,"end":970},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":971,"end":973},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1015},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1018},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1196},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1205},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1216},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1228,"end":1241},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1250},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1251,"end":1261},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1348,"end":1353},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1358,"end":1366},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1419,"end":1424},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1425,"end":1435},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1464,"end":1473},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1603,"end":1608},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1609,"end":1616},"obj":"Localization"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E18","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E20","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E23","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E23"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E25","obj":"E24"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E25"},{"id":"R29","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E26"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E27"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E27","obj":"E28"},{"id":"R32","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E29"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E26"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E28"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
