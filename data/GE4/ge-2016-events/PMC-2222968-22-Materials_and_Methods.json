Thereafter, spleen and lymph node cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, and CD25 expression. The anti-mouse IL-4 mAb MAB404 was obtained from R&D Systems, the second anti-mouse IL-4 mAb 11B11 was purchased from eBioscience.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":182,"end":186},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":235,"end":239},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":256,"end":260},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":368,"end":371},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":373,"end":376},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":382,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":387,"end":397},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":387,"end":397},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":387,"end":397},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":414,"end":418},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":483,"end":487},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E3"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
