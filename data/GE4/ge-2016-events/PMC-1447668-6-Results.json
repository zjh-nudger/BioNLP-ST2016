We therefore quantitated the Foxp3 protein expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells by flow cytometry and the HTLV-I proviral load (a surrogate marker of viral replication) by real-time PCR from eight patients with HAM/TSP and eight asymptomatic carriers (ACs). The data from this analysis is summarized in Table 1. As expected, patients with HAM/TSP exhibited significantly higher proviral loads (indicated as HTLV-I proviral DNA copies/100 cells) (34.68 \u00b1 23.19) compared to ACs (4.75 \u00b1 5.47) (p = 0.0008). The percentage of Foxp3+ cells within the CD4+CD25+ T cell population was significantly greater in ACs (43.23 \u00b1 12.95) than in HAM/TSP patients (18.59 \u00b1 5.77) (p = 0.0033). These data suggest that high levels of Foxp3 protein expression are associated with reduced HTLV-I replication in vivo. They also support our recent reports that high proviral loads, which have been shown to correlate with high Tax mRNA in HTLV-I-infected patients, are associated with reduced Foxp3 expression [8,34].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":24,"end":34},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":85,"end":90},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":94,"end":103},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":134,"end":138},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":261,"end":266},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":341,"end":346},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":355,"end":365},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":369,"end":372},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":373,"end":377},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":830,"end":835},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":854,"end":857},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":858,"end":862},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1009,"end":1013},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1029},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1038,"end":1048},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1208,"end":1212},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1213,"end":1216},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1271,"end":1278},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1279,"end":1284},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1285,"end":1295},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
