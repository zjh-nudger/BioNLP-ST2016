At sampling the cells were pelleted followed by RNA extraction using 100 \u03bcl TRI-reagent (Sigma, USA). This was followed by addition of 100 \u03bcl chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24/1). The solutions were mixed by vortexing followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The upper phase was transferred to a new tube followed by addition of 100 \u03bcl iso-propanol and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. RNA was then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C and washed with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 25 \u03bcl RNase free water and the yield and ratio (A260/A280) was determined using NanoVue (GE Healthcare, UK). The samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until further use.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
