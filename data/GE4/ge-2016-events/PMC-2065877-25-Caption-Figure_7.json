Splenocytes were cultured with or without inhibitors of NF\u03baB (BAY11), mTOR (rapamycin), Akt (triciribine), MEK1/2 (U0126), p38 (SB202190), or Stat3 (cucurbitacin I and AG490) at the indicated concentrations. The results are the mean \u00b1 SEM of triplicate samples. Shown are the results for (A and B) WT lymphoma 1, (C and D) LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 2, and (E and F) one out of two LMP1 transgenic mice analyzed. This analysis was repeated with LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 4 yielding similar results.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":15,"end":20},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":190},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":257,"end":267},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":257,"end":267},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":257,"end":267},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":257,"end":267},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":257,"end":267},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":285,"end":289},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":303,"end":306},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":322,"end":326},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":327,"end":328},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":357,"end":362},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":538,"end":542},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":595,"end":599},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":658,"end":662},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
