IL-4 and IL-13 regulate the expression of IgE from B lymphocytes, whereas IL-5 plays a key role in eosinophilic inflammation [1]. Th2 cytokines are regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-3, which is predominantly expressed in Th2 cells [2],[3]. GATA-3 determines Th2 cell differentiation and selectively activates the promoters of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 through chromatin remodelling [4]\u2013[7]. The key role of GATA-3 in allergic airway inflammation has been demonstrated in mice by the reduced release of Th2 cytokines in animals treated with dominant-negative mutants of GATA-3 and by local application of antisense oligonucleotides to GATA-3 [8],[9]. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of the Gata3 gene in mice reduces expression of Th2 cytokines in vitro and in vivo [10], and similar results have been reported in isolated murine CD4+ lymphocytes [11]. Finally, knockdown of GATA-3 expression using siRNA in human T cells results in loss of anti-CD3/CD28-mediated Th2 cytokine expression [12].\nIn order for GATA-3 to regulate gene expression, it must translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to access its target genes. Enhanced nuclear expression of GATA-3 following T cell receptor activation was first demonstrated in murine T cells [13] and was recently confirmed in human T cells following T cell receptor and co-receptor stimulation [12]. GATA-3 contains a classical nuclear import signal [14] and is transported into the nucleus by the nuclear import protein importin-\u03b1 (also known as karyopherin-\u03b1) [12]. Deletion of a region encompassing the GATA-3 nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) region in murine and human cells prevents its nuclear localisation [12],[14]. The affinity of the importin-\u03b1\u2013NLS interaction is regulated by phosphorylation [15], and we have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a critical role in phosphorylating GATA-3 to enhance its interaction with importin-\u03b1 and subsequent transport into the nucleus [12].\nCorticosteroids are highly effective in the treatment of allergic inflammation, with marked suppression of Th2 cytokines in airways of patients with asthma [16]. Corticosteroids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of steroid-sensitive genes. Alternatively, activated GR interacts with coactivator molecules to suppress the expression of inflammatory genes by inhibiting the action of proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) through the recruitment of co-repressor molecules such as histone deacetylase-2 [17],[18].\nNuclear localisation and retention of GR is mediated through the nuclear localisation sequences NL1 and NL2 [19], by nuclear retention signals [20], and by control of nuclear export via a chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM-1) dependent pathway [21]. NL1, which is similar to the SV40 NLS, binds to importin-\u03b1 [22]. NL1 is activated both by glucocorticoid agonists such as dexamethasone and fluticasone propionate (FP) and by glucocorticoid antagonists such as mifepristone (RU486) [23]. NL1 can be mutated, and the resulting GR still translocates to the nucleus in response to ligands, but via interaction with importin 7, an event that requires an as-yet unknown component [23]. NL2 is poorly defined, residing in the ligand-binding domain, and much less is known about its mechanism of GR import [24]. A variety of other factors are also important for the regulation of GR activation and nuclear import including chaperones such as Hsp90 and other immunophilins [24]\u2013[26] and FK506-binding proteins that may be linked to dynein and/or peptidylprolyl isomerase [27],[28].\nHowever, the molecular basis for the inhibition of Th2 cytokines by corticosteroids is not well understood, because the genes encoding IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 do not have any recognisable GRE sequence [29] and are only partly regulated by NF-\u03baB in human cells [30]\u2013[32]. Using overexpression and CAT-reporter genes, Lavender and colleagues [33] have shown that GR reduced GATA-3-mediated IL-5 and -13 promoter activity in human CD4+ T cells. The authors postulated that local recruitment of GR may alter the ability of GATA-3 either to bind to its target site, to cause transcriptional up-regulation, or to maintain an environment that is permissive for transcription.\nWe therefore investigated the effects of a synthetic corticosteroid, FP, on GATA-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in a T lymphocyte cell line (HuT-78) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro. We also studied the effects of inhaled fluticasone therapy on GATA-3 subcellular localization in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with asthma.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":144},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":156,"end":161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":191,"end":195},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":200,"end":205},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":265,"end":269},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":389,"end":395},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":420,"end":429},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":452,"end":458},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":511,"end":520},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":511,"end":520},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":511,"end":520},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":525,"end":534},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":538,"end":542},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":544,"end":548},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":554,"end":559},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":615,"end":621},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":777,"end":783},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":842,"end":848},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":900,"end":905},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1043},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1081},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1091},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1092,"end":1102},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1223},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1261,"end":1272},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":1301,"end":1308},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1312,"end":1318},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1329},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":1346,"end":1353},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1354,"end":1364},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1374},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1375,"end":1384},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1502,"end":1511},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1568},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1624,"end":1635},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":1645,"end":1652},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1768,"end":1774},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":2058,"end":2062},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":2066,"end":2081},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2082,"end":2088},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":2092,"end":2099},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":2104,"end":2115},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":2406,"end":2413},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2417,"end":2441},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2443,"end":2446},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":2460,"end":2471},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":2479,"end":2486},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":2498,"end":2506},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":2619,"end":2628},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2629,"end":2631},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":2632,"end":2641},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":2830,"end":2841},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2876,"end":2897},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T79","span":{"begin":2909,"end":2916},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":2917,"end":2929},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":2934,"end":2943},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2947,"end":2949},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":2953,"end":2961},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":2953,"end":2961},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":3065,"end":3072},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T84","span":{"begin":3076,"end":3083},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":3084,"end":3090},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":3097,"end":3129},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":3131,"end":3136},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":3138,"end":3147},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T87","span":{"begin":3162,"end":3165},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":3201,"end":3206},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":3427,"end":3436},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":3437,"end":3439},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":3446,"end":3458},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T91","span":{"begin":3466,"end":3473},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":3474,"end":3488},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E35","span":{"begin":3506,"end":3517},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":3523,"end":3533},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E36","span":{"begin":3549,"end":3557},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":3700,"end":3702},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E37",
