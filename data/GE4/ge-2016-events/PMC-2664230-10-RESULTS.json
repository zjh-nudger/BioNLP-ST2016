Cytoplasmic I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation was markedly increased following LPS stimulation when compared to control (100 \u00b1 0 vs. 20 \u00b1 18; P < 0.05). The addition of PTX significantly downregulated LPS-induced I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation (P = 0.02; Figure 2)\nIn a similar fashion, nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation was increased following LPS stimulation (100 \u00b1 0 vs. 38 \u00b1 20; P < 0.01). PTX similarly decreased LPS-induced NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear phosphorylation, a marker of NF-\u03baB activation and nuclear translocation (100 \u00b1 0 vs. 40 \u00b1 6; P =0.03; Figure 3A).\nEMSAs were then performed to verify the PTX-induced alterations in nuclear phosphorylation resulted in similar effects on the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. The addition of PTX to LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells resulted in comparable downregulation of DNA binding activity, similar to the observed downregulation of NF-\u03baB phosphorylation (Figure 3B).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":65,"end":70},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":93,"end":104},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":108,"end":113},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":183,"end":190},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":201,"end":206},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":220,"end":225},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":226,"end":241},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":255,"end":264},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":265,"end":274},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":383,"end":396},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":401,"end":408},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":415,"end":430},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":488,"end":491},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":492,"end":507},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":512,"end":521},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":522,"end":531},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":595,"end":604},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":609,"end":616},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":623,"end":626},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":635,"end":650},"obj":"Phosphorylation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
