As shown in Figure 4 (upper panel), the peptide substrate was maximally phosphorylated within 10 minutes of stimulation (1.8-fold over resting cells, lower panel), and then returned to basal levels by 15 minutes. This effect was not seen in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes when isogenic antibodies (IgG) were used for immunoprecipitation. Western blots of identical samples using an antibody recognizing PKC\u03b1 demonstrated that equal amounts of PKC\u03b1 were assayed (Figure 4, middle panel).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":132,"end":137},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":219,"end":223},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":230,"end":247},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":251,"end":256},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":691,"end":696},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E1"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
