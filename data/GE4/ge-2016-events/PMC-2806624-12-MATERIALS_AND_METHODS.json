Naive (CD62Lhi44lo25\u2212) CD4+ T cells (effectors) were FACS-purified from Cd45.1 mice, then loaded with 5 \u00b5M CFSE (Invitrogen). Total splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice inactivated with 50 \u00b5g/ml mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min were used as APCs. A total of 4 \u00d7 105 CD4+ cells (CFSE-loaded CD25\u2212 plus Foxp3-GFP+) was mixed with 105 APCs + 1 \u00b5g/ml anti-CD3 mAb per well of a 96 well round bottom plate. Proliferation of the effector cells was analyzed by CFSE dilution. Apoptosis of the cells was investigated by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. Positive and negative control gates were made according to T cells cultured only in the presence of IL-2 without anti-CD3/28 stimulation.\nHuman naive CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection by MACS from PBMCs and either transfected with a scrambled siRNA or with a combination of RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA. Cells were then cultured under iT reg cell differentiating conditions and mixed with 2 \u00d7 105 autologous irradiated PBMCs that were used as APCs and autologous CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells. T reg cell to responder cell ratio was 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5. To check the proliferation of the CD4+ T cells without suppression, no T reg cells were added in a control group. Cells were stimulated with 2.5 \u00b5g/ml anti-CD3 mAb, cultured in a 96-well plate and the proliferation of the effector cells was determined by analyzing the CFSE dilution by flow cytometry after 5 d of culture. Gating on the CD4+CFSE+ T cells enabled the exclusion of APCs and T reg cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":40},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":42,"end":45},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":47,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":88,"end":91},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":92,"end":101},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":109,"end":114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":120,"end":123},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":141,"end":146},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":146,"end":149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":159,"end":164},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":166,"end":168},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":170,"end":172},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":224,"end":230},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":417,"end":420},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":441,"end":445},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":452,"end":461},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":503,"end":506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":663,"end":672},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":802,"end":806},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":820,"end":823},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":824,"end":826},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":852,"end":855},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":991,"end":996},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1001,"end":1006},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1012},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1012},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1186,"end":1189},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1294,"end":1297},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1416,"end":1419},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1597,"end":1600},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
