These cytokines can be divided into three subgroups: TGF-\u03b2, the activins/inhibins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), of which the latter constitute the largest family. BMPs are 30\u201338 kDa hetero- or homodimeric proteins originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation [2,3]. Several studies have demonstrated an essential role of these proteins during embryogenesis, and more recently, also in adult tissues [1]. TGF-\u03b2 has been intensively studied in normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and is one of the most potent endogenous negative regulators known to date. [4]. In contrast, the effect of BMPs in the immune system has not been widely investigated. In that respect, BMP- 2, -4 and -7 have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [5] and early T cell development [6,7]. BMP-6 has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone-area-forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells [8]. Furthermore, BMP-2, -4, 6 and -7 had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells [9-11]. In addition, by gene expression profiling, BMP-6 significantly increased the predictive value for a multi-gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) [12].\nBMP-6, like the other BMP members, signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of BMP type I [activin-like-kinase (ALK)] and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating Smad proteins. BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIA, and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII, Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8). The R- Smads then form complexes with the co-Smad (Smad4) and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation [1,13].\nGiven the reported role of BMP-6 in B-cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells, we wanted to explore its potential role in normal human B cells. We studied the effects of BMP-6 on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated B cells. Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1\u2013Id4, were resolved. Finally, we investigated whether B cells also were capable of producing BMP-6.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":15,"end":43},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":221,"end":226},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":628,"end":633},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":893,"end":899},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":901,"end":903},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":908,"end":910},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1027},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1165},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1167,"end":1168},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1173,"end":1175},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1309},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":1324,"end":1333},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1479},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":1525,"end":1533},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":1538,"end":1555},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1736},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1768},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1768},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1768},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1768},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1768},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1768},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1793,"end":1800},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1802,"end":1809},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1822},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1856},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1858,"end":1866},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1871,"end":1879},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1891},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1899,"end":1914},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1899,"end":1914},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1899,"end":1914},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1938,"end":1944},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1946,"end":1952},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1958,"end":1964},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":1985,"end":1999},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":1985,"end":1999},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":1985,"end":1999},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2018,"end":2023},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E36","span":{"begin":2033,"end":2045},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E35","span":{"begin":2033,"end":2045},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":2033,"end":2045},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":2055,"end":2062},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2131,"end":2136},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2288,"end":2293},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E37","span":{"begin":2377,"end":2387},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2409,"end":2414},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E40","span":{"begin":2415,"end":2422},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E38","span":{"begin":2415,"end":2422},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E41","span":{"begin":2481,"end":2491},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E39","span":{"begin":2481,"end":2491},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2512,"end":2515},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2516,"end":2519},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E42","span":{"begin":2598,"end":2607},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2608,"end":2613},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R
