The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Unspecific binding was blocked with 3% milk in TBS Tween, and the membranes were subsequently incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX1 (ab11903; Abcam) or 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX3 (H-50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in blocking buffer containing 3% milk in TBS Tween overnight at 4\u00b0C. The blots were developed using an anti-rabbit IgG HRP-labeled mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) and visualized with a LAS-1000 gel documentation system (Fujifilm). To confirm sample loading and transfer membranes were incubated in stripping buffer and reblocked for 1 h and reprobed using anti-GAPDH (6C5; Ambion) and developed using an anti\u2013mouse IgG HRP-labeled mAb (Cell Signaling Technology).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":33},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":43},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":60,"end":73},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":60,"end":73},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":465,"end":470},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":871,"end":876},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
