The cytokine profile revealed an enhanced induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-6, TNF and the chemokine CXCL8. The levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were unaffected by PMA but were significantly decreased by HK E. coli (Table 1). These results confirmed that PMA and HK E. coli induced an inflammatory response in the Jurkat T-cells. It is interesting to note that PMA was 120-fold more effective at inducing CXCL8 than HK E. coli. PMA-dependent induction of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-\u03baB suggests an involvement of AP-1 in CXCL8 regulation. Determination of the time course of cytokine induction in response to PMA showed that CXCL8 was already released between 2-6 h, while TNF and IL-6 were released between 6-24 h (figure 3). These results indicated that the cytokines were differentially regulated and that the release was not associated with the early transient induction of NF-\u03baB. The temporal induction of AP-1 correlated to the CXCL8 levels and preceded the TNF and IL-6 release. This suggests an association between CXCL8 release and AP-1 signalling.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":231,"end":239},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":240,"end":249},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":284,"end":288},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":370,"end":375},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":381,"end":391},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":422,"end":431},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":614,"end":623},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":627,"end":635},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":636,"end":641},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":732,"end":743},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":755,"end":760},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":761,"end":771},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":859,"end":864},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":877,"end":885},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":915,"end":919},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":925,"end":933},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1033},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1033},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1168,"end":1173},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1210},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1211,"end":1218},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1262},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1263,"end":1270},"obj":"Localization"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
