Allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice by negative selection kit (Invitrogen) and were then added at 2.5\u00d7105 and co-cultured with activated BMDC. After 5 days, supernatant was collected and the secretion of IFN\u03b3, IL4, IL2, and IL17A measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Both negative controls show no production of aforementioned cytokines.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":415,"end":424},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":415,"end":424},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":415,"end":424},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":415,"end":424},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":428,"end":432},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":434,"end":437},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":439,"end":442},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":448,"end":453},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":662,"end":672},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":662,"end":672},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":662,"end":672},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":662,"end":672},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M6","pred":"Negation","obj":"E6"},{"id":"M7","pred":"Negation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M8","pred":"Negation","obj":"E8"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
