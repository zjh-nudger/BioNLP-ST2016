The cells were incubated in PBS with 0.1% NaN3, 1% BSA and 10% normal rabbit serum for 20 minutes on ice, washed and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with Alex Fluor-labeled anti-CD11c (MCD11C20, CALTAG) in combination with PE- anti-CD40 (3/23, BD Biosciences), PE-anti-CD80 (16-10A1, eBioscience), PE-anti-CD86 (P03.1, eBioscience), PE-anti-CD14 (Sa2.8, eBioscience) and biotinylated anti-TLR4 (BioLegend). The cells incubated with biotinylated anti-TLR4/MD-2 were washed twice and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with avidin-PE. To isolate splenic DC, spleens were collagenase digested and subject to Percoll gradient centrifugation. The bands at the 35\u201355% interface were collected to stain with PE-anti-CD11c (HL3, BioLegend), APC-anti-PDCA-1 (927, BioLegend) and FITC-anti-CD8\u03b1 (53\u20136.7, BD BioScience). The cells were washed twice, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and stored at 4\u00b0C until analysis. Flow cytometry was performed in an Excel (Coulter) instrument. Dead cells were omitted from the analysis by gating on forward and 90\u00b0 light scatter, and 10,000 cells were analyzed by FlowJo software.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
