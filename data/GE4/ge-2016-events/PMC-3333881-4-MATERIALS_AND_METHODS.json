Briefly, aliquots (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells) were suspended in 0.3\u2009ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and subjected to a double electrical pulse (0.22\u2009V, 960\u2009\u00b5F) in the presence of annealed siRNA (200\u2009pmol); electroporated cells were washed and cultured in complete medium. RNA interference was performed with: siRNA Tat sense, CUGCUUGUACCAAUUGCUAUU and siRNA Tat antisense, UAGCAAUUGGUACAAGCAGUU; siRNA control sense, CUGCUUGUCACA AUUGCUAUU and siRNA control antisense, UAGCAAUUGUGACAAGCAGUU. RNA interference of p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 was performed with SMART pool siRNA p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL, USA).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":463,"end":478},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":506,"end":525},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":650,"end":662},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":650,"end":662},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":666,"end":669},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":674,"end":679},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":710,"end":719},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":724,"end":729},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
