The expression of various cell surface molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry as described in materials and methods. Both forms of dCGN clearly stimulated expression of ICAM-1 (CD54) on PBM and THP-1 cells (Fig. 4A). The increase in ICAM-1 expression was higher on THP-1 cells treated with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B). Another surface antigen, the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (CD58) was slightly reduced on PBM after treatment with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules of class I (HLA-ABC) and of class II (HLA-DR), as well as the monocyte marker CD14, seemed to be reduced by treatment with dCGN (Fig. 4B). However, these differences were not statistically significant.\nTreatment with dCGN also induced a strong aggregation of monocytes, detected by phase contrast inverse microscopy (Fig. 5). Although this effect was easily observed in monocytes incubated with the 10 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5B), a more robust cell aggregation was observed in monocytes incubated with the 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5C). ICAM-1 has been proposed to be the main adhesion molecule responsible for monocyte aggregation. To confirm this, monocytes were incubated with both types of dCGN in the presence of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody, an anti-CD58 antibody and an isotype control IgG1 antibody. The anti-ICAM-1 antibody effectively blocked the cell aggregates induced by dCGN (Fig. 5D, 5E), strongly suggesting that indeed ICAM-1 is responsible for monocyte aggregation. Both the control IgG1 and the anti-CD58 antibody did not modify monocyte aggregation (data not shown).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":7,"end":17},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":21,"end":28},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":407,"end":417},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":418,"end":428},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":432,"end":438},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":440,"end":444},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":484,"end":492},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":496,"end":502},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":503,"end":513},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":605,"end":645},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":647,"end":651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":740,"end":750},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":859,"end":874},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":875,"end":879},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":894,"end":901},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1324},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1712,"end":1718},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R2","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
