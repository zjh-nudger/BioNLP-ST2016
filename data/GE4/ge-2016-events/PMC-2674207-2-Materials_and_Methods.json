Seven patients with mild asthma entered the study and were randomized to receive a single inhalation of FP (100 and 500 \u00b5g) or a matched placebo control via a spacer chamber, and the other treatment was given after a wash-out period of at least 6 d. Blood was taken for preparation of PBMCs at 1 and 2 h after drug administration. All patients gave informed consent and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals NHS Trust. The clinical study was conducted before the requirement for Clinical Trial Registration.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
