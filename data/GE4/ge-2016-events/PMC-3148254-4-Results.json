It follows that HOIP is likely a key mediator of CD40 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated A20.2J and HOIP-deficient cells with CD154 (CD40 ligand) expressed by HI5 insect cells [7], [8] and measured activation of the NF-\u03baB and JNK pathways, two of the major transcriptional regulators activated by CD40 [4]. Cell-associated CD154 was used as the stimulus in these experiments as it typically provides more robust, and therefore more readily detected, activation signals than does anti-CD40 antibody. Activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway is initiated with the phosphorylation of I\u03baB proteins by the I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK). In resting cells, I\u03baB proteins are responsible for sequestering NF-\u03baB subunits in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation by the IKK complex targets I\u03baB proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, allowing NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus and activate gene expression. CD40-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in HOIP-deficient cells was dramatically impaired relative to that observed in parental A20.2J cells (Fig. 4). We also assayed activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK in response to CD40 engagement (Fig. 4). CD40-mediated JNK activation in HOIP-deficient cells was impaired as measured by phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 in JNK. CD40-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK in HOIP-reconstituted cells was normal, demonstrating that the defects observed in gene-deficient cells were due to the absence of HOIP expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":93,"end":97},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":125,"end":129},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":186,"end":190},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":219,"end":223},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":311,"end":316},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":318,"end":329},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":331,"end":340},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":482,"end":486},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":497,"end":507},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":508,"end":513},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":848,"end":859},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":864,"end":876},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":877,"end":891},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1072},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1081},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1081},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1082,"end":1097},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1102,"end":1113},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1121},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1129},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1130,"end":1139},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1171},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1171},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1322},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1333},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1344,"end":1348},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1376,"end":1380},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1381,"end":1390},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1470,"end":1474},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1514,"end":1518},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1519,"end":1532},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1642,"end":1646},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1647,"end":1657},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R10","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E15"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
