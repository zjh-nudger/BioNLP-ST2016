The prepared cDNAs were amplified using SYBR-PCR mastermix (Biorad) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer in an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).\nQuantitative PCR of murine samples was performed with Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Stratagene) and the following primers: Ubiquitin C, 5\u2032- AGG TCA AAC AGG AAG ACA GAC GTA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCACACCCAAGAACAAGCACA-3\u2032; Smad-7, 5\u2032-GAA ACC GGG GGA ACG AAT TAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGC GAG TCT TCT CCT CCC A-3\u2032; TGF-\u00df1, 5\u2032-TGA CGT CAC TGG AGT TGT ACG G-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGT TCA TGT CAT GGA TGG TGC-3\u2032. Primer pairs were evaluated for integrity by analysis of the amplification plot, dissociation curves, and efficiency of PCR amplification. PCR conditions were 10 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min using an 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification of the housekeeping gene encoding ubiquitin C was performed during each run for each sample to allow normalization between samples. Relative quantification and calculation of the range of confidence was performed using the comparative \u0394\u0394CT method.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":190,"end":195},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":249,"end":254},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":300,"end":305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":359,"end":364},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":778,"end":789},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":863,"end":869},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":942,"end":948},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1369,"end":1380},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
