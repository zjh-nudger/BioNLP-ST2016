Detection of the BMP-6-protein has been tried with the following antibodies: goat polyclonal anti-BMP-6 (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA, USA), monoclonal mouse anti-BMP-6 and polyclonal goat anti-BMP-6 from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and mouse monoclonal anti-BMP-6 (Chemicon International Inc, Temecula, CA, USA).\nCharacterisation of BMP-signalling pathways was done by use of anti-phospho-Smad1, -5, -and 8 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Expression levels of Id1\u20133 proteins were detected with polyclonal rabbit antibody and detection was blocked with blocking peptide from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA, USA). As secondary antibodies served anti-mouse, anti-goat or anti-rabbit IgG- horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from Dakocytomation AS (Copenhagen, Denmark) for immunoblot analysis. Anti-\u03b2-actin was from Santa-Cruz. From Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA), we purchased anti-CD19-PE, anti-CD19-FITC. The antibodies used for cell sorting were anti-CD19 PC5 from Immunotech SA (Marseille, France) and anti-CD27 PE from Becton Dickinson, Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA, USA).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":112,"end":119},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":121,"end":128},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":130,"end":137},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":139,"end":147},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":152,"end":160},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":228,"end":233},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":309,"end":314},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":371,"end":376},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":402,"end":407},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":469,"end":474},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":600,"end":605},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":607,"end":609},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":616,"end":617},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":669,"end":686},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":669,"end":686},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":690,"end":693},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":694,"end":695},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":769,"end":776},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":769,"end":776},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1047},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1129},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1143},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1197,"end":1201},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1254,"end":1258},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
