After 48 hr, they were injected subcutaneously with PBS or with OVA protein (5 mg) plus LPS (5 \u03bcg). The inguinal lymph nodes were removed 48 hr later. A single-cell suspension (1 \u00d7 106 cells) was restimulated for 24 or 48 hr with 1 \u03bcM or 3 \u03bcM of OVA and with BrefeldinA for the last 6 hr. Half of the supernatant was removed before the addition of BrefeldinA for use in an ELISA assay. The cells were fixed and stained as before. Those positive for KJ1-26-Bio and for CD4-PerCP were gated, and IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 staining was examined for this population and analyzed as before.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":188,"end":197},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":268,"end":271},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":450,"end":453},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":653,"end":659},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":672,"end":675},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":698,"end":703},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":708,"end":713},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
