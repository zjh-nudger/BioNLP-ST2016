As a control, untreated cells were incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody recognizing the active cleaved form of caspase-3. The blots were reblotted with \u03b2-actin that served as a loading control. The ratio of active caspase-3 bands (17 kD and 19 kD) to \u03b2-actin control was determined by densitometry analysis (bottom panel). Data represents the mean \u00b1 S.E.M from two independent donors. (B) Apoptosis of the treated MDMs was also measured by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of surviving cells (Annexin V/PI negative) for the cells treated with vehicle/M-CSF was arbitrarily set as 100. Data shown represent the mean \u00b1 S.E.M from three independent experiments. *The p-values of inhibitors/M-CSF compared to vehicle/M-CSF were \u22640.05.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":211,"end":216},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":446,"end":453},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":501,"end":507},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":508,"end":517},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":545,"end":552},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":734,"end":743},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":851,"end":860},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":864,"end":872},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":909,"end":914},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1050},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1071,"end":1076},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
