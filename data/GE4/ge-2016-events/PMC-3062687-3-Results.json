Given that RPS3 can be found in the cytoplasmic p65-p50-I\u03baB\u03b1 inhibitory complex in resting cells6, we hypothesized that activated IKK\u03b2 might also bind to and phosphorylate RPS3. First, we found that ectopically expressed IKK\u03b2 and RPS3 interacted (Fig. 1c). We next examined resting Jurkat cells and detected a modest endogenous IKK\u03b2-RPS3 interaction (Fig. 1d), potentially accounting for the basal NF-\u03baB transcription required for cell proliferation and survival. RPS3-IKK\u03b2 association was clearly augmented upon TNF stimulation, peaking at 10 min. (Fig. 1d), following similar kinetics to RPS3 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 1b). By contrast, there was no detectable interaction between RPS3 and IKK\u03b1 (Fig. 1d).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":9,"end":13},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":14,"end":25},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":113,"end":117},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":155,"end":159},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":278,"end":282},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":315,"end":318},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":319,"end":322},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":323,"end":327},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":387,"end":396},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":397,"end":401},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":413,"end":417},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":425,"end":438},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":439,"end":443},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":478,"end":487},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":488,"end":492},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":497,"end":501},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":502,"end":512},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":595,"end":599},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":600,"end":604},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":605,"end":616},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":731,"end":735},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":736,"end":740},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":741,"end":752},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":765,"end":774},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":827,"end":836},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":857,"end":861},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":862,"end":868},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":869,"end":884},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":933,"end":944},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":953,"end":957},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":962,"end":966},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T31","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R18","pred":"partOf","subj":"T31","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E12"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
