Briefly, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) according to manufacturer's guidelines, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using TaqMan Gold RT-PCR Kit using random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States). Foxp3 and HTLV-I Tax mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR using ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The normalized values in each sample were calculated as the relative quantity of Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax mRNA expression divided by the relative quantity of HPRT mRNA expression. The values were calculated by the following formula: normalized Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax expression = 2Ct value of HPRT \u2013 Ct value of Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":20},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":21,"end":31},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":21,"end":31},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":91,"end":96},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":108,"end":111},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":112,"end":122},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":112,"end":122},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":484,"end":489},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":501,"end":504},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":505,"end":520},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":505,"end":520},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":703,"end":708},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":719,"end":722},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":723,"end":738},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":723,"end":738},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":775,"end":779},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":780,"end":795},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":861,"end":866},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":877,"end":880},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":881,"end":891},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":881,"end":891},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":907,"end":911},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":926,"end":931},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":942,"end":945},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M10","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E10"},{"id":"M11","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E11"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M6","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E6"},{"id":"M7","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M8","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E8"},{"id":"M9","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
