The transcriptional start sites of A3G were identified using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE Kit, 2nd Generation (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were used: RACE-APO3G1 (5\u2032-TATCCCTTGTACACTTTGT-3\u2032) for cDNA synthesis, RACE-APO3G2 (5\u2032-CATACTCCTGGTCACGAT-3\u2032) for the first PCR and RACE-APO3Gnest (5\u2032-GAATACACCTGGCCTCGAA-3\u2032) for the nested PCR. Reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), T/A-cloned into vector pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":161,"end":164},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
