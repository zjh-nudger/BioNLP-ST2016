Crude lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatants were collected for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay system. Lysates were boiled in the presence of 2.5% \u03b2-mecaptoethanol, separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE, and transferred to 0.45-\u03bcm Optitran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in a Bio-Rad transfer unit. Membranes were immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase\u2013tagged secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences and Dako) and detected with the SuperSignal West Pico System (Pierce).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":812,"end":822},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
