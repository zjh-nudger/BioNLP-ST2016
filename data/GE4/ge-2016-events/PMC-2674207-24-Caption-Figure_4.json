(B) GR isolated from FP (10\u22128 M) stimulated cells enhances GR\u2013importin-\u03b1 binding in the presence (\u2022) and absence (\u25aa) of activated GATA-3. * p<0.05 compared to no activated GR. (C) GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated cells does not attenuate GR\u2013importin-\u03b1 association. *p<0.05 compared to control. (D) Activated GR blocks the ability of purified phospho-GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated cells interacting with immobilised importin-\u03b1 in an in vitro binding assay. *p<0.05 compared to GATA-3 isolated from unstimulated cells. #p<0.05 compared to stimulated GATA-3-importin binding. (E) The effect of activated (\u2022) versus unstimulated (\u25cb) GR on attenuation of GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association was concentration-dependent. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 between groups. All results are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM of three independent experiments and analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":37,"end":44},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":45,"end":51},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":144,"end":146},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":190,"end":198},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":199,"end":201},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":213,"end":220},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":270,"end":276},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":302,"end":311},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":312,"end":314},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":320,"end":326},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":381,"end":390},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":391,"end":393},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":405,"end":416},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":451,"end":460},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":461,"end":463},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":464,"end":470},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":495,"end":502},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":503,"end":509},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":555,"end":566},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":645,"end":651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":706,"end":716},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":717,"end":723},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":733,"end":740},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":760,"end":769},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":781,"end":793},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":798,"end":800},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":804,"end":815},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":819,"end":825},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":837,"end":848},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":867,"end":876},"obj":"Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E16","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R19","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R3","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E14"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
