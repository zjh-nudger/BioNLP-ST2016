Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) is a key inflammatory mediator. Secretion of biologically active IL-1\u03b2 involves inflammasome-mediated processing. Little is known about the contribution of IL-1\u03b2 and the inflammasomes in CF inflammatory disease. This study examines inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 production in CF bronchial epithelial cell lines and human patients with CF.\nResults\nBronchial epithelial cell lines were found to produce negligible amounts of basal or stimulated IL-1\u03b2 compared to hematopoeitic cells and they did not significantly upregulate caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both CF and healthy control subjects produced large amounts of IL-1\u03b2 and strongly upregulated caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. PBMCs from CF patients and controls displayed similar levels of caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production when stimulated with inflammasome activators. This IL-1\u03b2 production was dependent on NF-\u03baB activity and could be enhanced by priming with LPS. Finally, chemical inhibition of CFTR activity in control PBMCs and THP-1 cells did not significantly alter IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 production in response to P. aeruginosa.\nConclusion\nHematopoeitic cells appear to be the predominant source of inflammasome-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 in CF. PBMCs derived from CF subjects display preserved inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to the major CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that increased IL-1\u03b2 production in CF subjects is due to an intrinsic increase in NF-\u03baB activity through loss of CFTR function.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":13,"end":21},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":27},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":28,"end":38},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":241,"end":259},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":261,"end":266},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":300,"end":309},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":333,"end":338},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":339,"end":347},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":424,"end":429},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":513,"end":521},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":522,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":528,"end":538},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":659,"end":666},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":698,"end":708},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":709,"end":714},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":937,"end":945},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":963,"end":968},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1017},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1133,"end":1138},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1149},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1165},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1206},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1394,"end":1399},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1400,"end":1405},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1414,"end":1424},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1425,"end":1439},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1538,"end":1545},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1568},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1615,"end":1624},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1653,"end":1658},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1668},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1783,"end":1792},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1792,"end":1798},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1799,"end":1809},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1828,"end":1831},"obj":"Positive_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E18","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E20","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E19","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E8"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E13"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E21"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
