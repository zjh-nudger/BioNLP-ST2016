To determine whether CFTR dysfunction alters IL-1\u03b2 production, THP-1 cells and PBMCs from CF patients and healthy controls were treated with the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, prior to simulation with live P. aeruginosa. Treatment with CFTRinh172 did not alter IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 production in control subjects or CF patients (Fig. 8a\u2013b). Similarly, IL-1\u03b2 production was not different in monocyte-derived macrophages or THP-1 reporter cells treated with CFTRinh172 (Fig. 8c\u2013d). IL-8 (Fig. 8e) and NF-\u03baB activity (Fig. 8f) were also unchanged in CFTRinh172-treated THP-1 reporter cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":37,"end":45},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":51},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":52,"end":62},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":249,"end":255},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":256,"end":261},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":262,"end":272},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":463,"end":468},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":469,"end":474},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":483,"end":493},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":553,"end":558},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":559,"end":569},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
