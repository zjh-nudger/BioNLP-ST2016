Cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u2009cells per well) in 1.5\u2009ml Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) containing 0.5\u2009\u00b5g firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 3.5\u2009\u00b5l DMRIE-C. After 4\u20135\u2009h of incubation, 1.5\u2009ml complete RPMI medium were added. HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies). Briefly, exponential growing cells (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with 5\u2009\u00b5l LipofectAMINE, 6\u2009\u00b5l PLUS reagent and the required amount of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 1\u2009ml Opti-MEM. Following 4\u2009h of incubation, cells were washed in PBS and 3\u2009ml of complete DMEM medium were added.\nFor cotransfection of reporter plasmids and siRNA into HeLa cells, HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for cotransfection of adherent cells with siRNA and plasmid DNA.\nTwo days after transfection of the respective cell lines, cells were harvested in 100\u2009\u00b5l (suspension cells) or 300\u2009\u00b5l (adherent cells) of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and luciferase assay was performed using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As an internal control, 50\u2009ng (adherent cells) or 100\u2009ng (suspension cells) of ph-RG-TK plasmid (Promega), which constitutively expresses renilla luciferase was cotransfected in every sample and firefly luciferase activities were normalized to renilla luciferase activities. Mean values (\u00b1SD) of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown in the figures. For stimulation of cells, final concentrations of 20\u2009ng/ml TPA (Sigma) or 30\u2009ng/ml IFN-\u03b1 or 30\u2009ng/ml IFN-\u03b3 (Tebu-Bio) were applied approximately 15\u2009h before harvesting for luciferase assay.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":273,"end":283},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1198},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":1442,"end":1451},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1460,"end":1470},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1517,"end":1527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1566,"end":1576},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1771,"end":1776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1789,"end":1794},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1860,"end":1870},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
