To further elucidate the role of BMPs in human B cells, we performed western blot analysis for type I and type II BMP receptors. This analysis revealed that the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII and Act-RIIb are expressed on resting human B-cells (Figure 4). Ramos cells expressed the type I receptors Act-RIA, weakly BMP-RIB and the type II receptor BMP-RII, but more weakly than normal B cells (Figure 4). HL60 cells were used for comparison and weakly expressed Act-RIA and BMP-RII.\nTaken together, these data show that normal human B cells and Ramos cells express a set of BMP receptors, previously shown to bind BMP-6 [16].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":27},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":322,"end":329},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":331,"end":338},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":365,"end":372},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":377,"end":385},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":390,"end":399},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":390,"end":399},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":390,"end":399},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":390,"end":399},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":449,"end":458},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":449,"end":458},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":449,"end":458},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":480,"end":487},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":496,"end":503},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":529,"end":536},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":633,"end":642},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":633,"end":642},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":643,"end":650},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":655,"end":662},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":790,"end":794},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":795,"end":800},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
