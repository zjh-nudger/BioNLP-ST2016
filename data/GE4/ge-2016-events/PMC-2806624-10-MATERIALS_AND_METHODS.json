For Th1 differentiation conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-4, and 25 ng/ml IL-12 (R&D Systems). For Th2 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 25 ng/ml IL-4, and 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12 (R&D Systems). For T reg cell conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-4. For Th17 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 20 ng/ml IL-6, 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2, 20 ng/ml IL-23 (Alexis Biochemicals Corp.), 10 ng/ml IL-1\u03b2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti-IL-4, and 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12 were used. Proliferating cells were expanded in medium containing IL-2. The cytokine profile of these cells demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 is the predominant cytokine in Th1 cells, IL-4 and IL-13 in Th2 cells, and IL-17 in Th17 cells (Akdis et al., 2000; Burgler et al., 2009).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":36},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":44},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":67,"end":73},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":74,"end":83},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":175},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":310,"end":314},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":329,"end":333},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":348,"end":353},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":440,"end":444},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":455,"end":459},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":478,"end":483},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":577,"end":581},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":591,"end":596},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":611,"end":616},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":631,"end":635},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":709,"end":713},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":724,"end":728},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":738,"end":743},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":754,"end":759},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":798,"end":803},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":818,"end":822},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":841,"end":846},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":913,"end":917},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":973,"end":978},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1025},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1035},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1054,"end":1059},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
