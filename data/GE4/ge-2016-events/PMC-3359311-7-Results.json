To validate its use in this study as an NF-\u03baB inhibitor, western blots for pro-IL-1\u03b2 were performed alongside inhibition of CFTR activity by CFTRinh172 in response to PAO1 at 4 hours after stimulation (Fig. 7a). Our results indicate that Bay11-7082 prevents production of pro-IL-1\u03b2 whereas CFTRinh172 does not seem to affect it. This was further corroborated by the ability Bay11-7082 to inhibit I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 hours post PAO1 stimulation (Fig. 7b).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":569,"end":576},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":577,"end":581},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":582,"end":593},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
