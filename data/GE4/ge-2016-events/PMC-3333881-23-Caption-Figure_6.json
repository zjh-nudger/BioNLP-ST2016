U937 cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009107) were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control (2\u2009nmol), or left untransfected; 24\u2009h later cells were infected with HXB2-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R\u2212E\u2212 virions (500\u2009ng of p24) and harvested at the indicated time. (A) Real-time PCR of total RNA measured the Tat expression; ELISA measured the amount of p24 in whole cell extracts. (B) The binding of p65 to the NF-\u03baB double-stranded oligonucleotide was measured in nuclear extracts (10\u2009\u00b5g) using the NF-\u03baB Transcription Factor ELISA assay kit (Cayman). (C) The I\u03baB-\u03b1 content was analysed by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and western blotting of cytosolic extracts (20\u2009\u00b5g) using anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibody. Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (mock). (D) IKK activity was measured in cytosolic cell extracts (100\u2009\u00b5g) using HTScan IKK Kinase Assay (Cell Signaling Technology). (E) U937 cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009107) were infected with HXB2-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R\u2212E\u2212 virions, or left uninfected. Twenty-four-hour post-infection, cell extracts (1\u2009mg) were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose-coupled anti-FLAG antibody. Immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-p65, anti-FLAG and anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibodies. (F) U937 cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009107) were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA p65, siRNA control (2\u2009nmol), or left untransfected; 24\u2009h later, cells were infected with HXB2-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R\u2212E\u2212 virions, or left uninfected. Twenty-four-hour post-infection, total RNA was analysed for MIP-1\u03b1 expression by real-time PCR. (G and H) U937 cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009107) were transfected with siRNA Tat or siRNA control (2\u2009nmol), or left untransfected; 24\u2009h later, cells were infected with HXB2-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R\u2212E\u2212 virions, or left uninfected. Twenty-four-hour post-infection, ChIP was performed with anti-p65 (G) or anti-FLAG (H). Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for MIP-1\u03b1 and GAPDH promoters. Values (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093) are shown. The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control (mock), according to the Student's t-test (P\u2009<\u20090.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":55,"end":63},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":68,"end":74},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":75,"end":85},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":90,"end":101},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":107,"end":112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":117,"end":120},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":165,"end":174},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":282,"end":290},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":315,"end":318},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":401,"end":404},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":405,"end":415},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":446,"end":449},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":482,"end":489},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":493,"end":496},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":654,"end":659},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1062,"end":1070},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1197},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1415,"end":1424},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1426,"end":1435},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1544,"end":1552},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1647,"end":1653},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1654,"end":1664},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1736,"end":1745},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1856,"end":1864},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2041,"end":2047},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2052,"end":2057},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
