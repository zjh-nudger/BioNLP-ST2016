Two allelic, autosomal recessive mutations in the Sharpin gene occurred spontaneously in two inbred strains of mice, C57B/KaLawRij-Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm and CBy.Ocb3/Dem-Sharpincpdm-Dem/Sharpincpdm-Dem, resulting in premature termination of mRNA synthesis and absence of a functional protein product [2]. Despite different genetic backgrounds, both mutations cause similar inflammatory disease with severe chronic progressive dermatitis and defective development of secondary lymphoid organs [2]\u2013[4]. The dermatitis becomes clinically apparent at about four weeks of age. There are accumulations of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages in the skin of Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm mutant mice (hereafter referred to as cpdm mice) associated with increased expression of Th2 cytokines in the skin and in the supernatants of activated splenocytes [5]. The mice have an impaired delayed type hypersensitivity response and decreased secretion of IFN\u03b3 [5], indicating a defect in Th1 immune responses and a bias towards a Th2 immune response. Systemic treatment of cpdm mice with recombinant IL12 caused complete remission of the dermatitis [5]. Neutralization of IL5 by antibody treatment or crosses with IL5-deficient mice reduced the number of circulating and cutaneous eosinophils, but failed to reduce the onset and severity of the dermatitis [6].\nRecently, three independent groups identified SHARPIN as an essential component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) that regulates TNF\u03b1-induced canonical NF-\u03baB signaling [7]\u2013[9]. SHARPIN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) were sensitized to TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis and cell death was implicated as a factor in the dermatitis of cpdm mice [7]\u2013[9].\nDendritic cells (DC) have a sentinel role in sensing pathogen or danger signals and initiate and direct activation of the adaptive immune response [10]. Activated and mature DC can carry processed antigenic peptides, migrate to lymphoid organs, and induce T-cell-mediated immune responses or tolerance. DC direct the differentiation of CD4+ T cells, and hence the type of immune response, through the selective secretion of cytokines. We hypothesized that defective cytokine secretion by DC contributed to the Th2-biased inflammatory phenotype in SHARPIN-deficient mice. The studies reported here found that lack of SHARPIN protein in BMDC caused defective expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and impaired NF-\u03baB activation upon ligand stimulation. The ability of cpdm BMDC to stimulate Th1 cytokine production in allogeneic CD4+ T cells was compromised. Taken together, these results reveal that SHARPIN is a novel regulatory molecule in DC biology and suggest that the dysregulated function of SHARPIN-deficient DC plays a role in the cpdm phenotype.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":137,"end":146},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":199,"end":218},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":226,"end":233},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":381,"end":390},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":381,"end":390},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":404,"end":415},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":424,"end":433},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":438,"end":445},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1095,"end":1104},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1105,"end":1114},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1118,"end":1122},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1331},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1335,"end":1338},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1380},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1381,"end":1390},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1570,"end":1577},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1674,"end":1678},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1722,"end":1729},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1730,"end":1739},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1792,"end":1796},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":2444,"end":2451},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":2452,"end":2461},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":2505,"end":2509},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":2513,"end":2520},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":2798,"end":2805},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2897,"end":2904},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":2905,"end":2914},"obj":"Negative_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
