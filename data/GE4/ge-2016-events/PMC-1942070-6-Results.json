Initial experiments revealed that surface expression of the BCR was reduced in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 (and in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212:Flag-PKD3+ve) cells compared to wild-type DT40 B cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Nevertheless, BCR-crosslinking of PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 cells was sufficient to induce the activation of a number of signalling cascades, similar to that observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B). Hence, BCR-induced activation of the Akt, mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (as shown by S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation) and MAPK signalling pathways was clearly detectable in PKD1/3-null B cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins as well as an increase in intracellular calcium levels was also observed following BCR stimulation of PKD1/3-null B cells (data not shown). We did observe that the strength of BCR (but not phorbol ester)-induced regulation of the Erk1-RSK1 signalling pathway was reduced in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 B cells compared to wild-type B cells (Fig. 3B). One interpretation of this data is that PKD enzymes may modulate Erk activation. Indeed, PKD enzymes have previously been linked to the growth factor-regulated Erk signalling in fibroblast and endothelial cell lines [33\u201335]. However, BCR-induced Erk phosphorylation was also reduced in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212-Flag-PKD3+ B cells (data not shown) suggesting that reduced BCR levels on the surface of PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 (and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212-Flag-PKD3+) B cells may itself impact on the strength of activation of this specific intracellular signalling pathway.\nTo search for other potential PKD targets that may show defective regulation in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells, we used a PKD substrate phospho-antibody that recognises consensus phosphorylation sequences targeted by PKD enzymes (LxRxxpS/T) [36]. As shown in Fig. 3C, phorbol ester- and BCR-induced phosphorylation of cellular substrates detected by this phospho-antibody was similar in wild-type and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 cells and is therefore independent of PKD enzymes. However, pretreatment of both wild-type and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells with GF109203X, a bisindoylmaleimide derivative that inhibits PKCs prevented the induction of proteins that contain phosphorylated LxRxxS/T motifs. Thus loss of PKD1/3 enzymes does not globally disrupt the phosphorylation of cellular proteins that contain LxRxxpS/T motifs. This result is perhaps not surprising as LxRxxS/T motifs also act as good substrates for other serine/threonine kinases such as MAPKAPK2. However these experiments do provide further evidence that phosphospecific antisera are not sufficiently selective to be designated kinase specific substrate antisera.\nBCR-induced signalling pathways culminate in the activation of gene transcription events that control B cell survival, proliferation and function. In this context, it has been proposed that PKD family members control of gene transcription through activation of the NF\u03baB transcription factor. Thus, PKD-mediated activation of NF\u03baB occurs downstream of a variety of different signals, including mROS/oxidative stress, lysophosphatidic acid and the Bcr-Abl oncogene [17,21,23,30,37]. Furthermore, expression of an activated PKD1 mutant enhances HPK1-mediated NF\u03baB activation [38]. In B cells, NF\u03baB is known to be regulated via DAG and PKC\u03b2 [39,40] but whether PKDs are key intermediaries for NF\u03baB regulation has not been explored.\nThe data (Fig. 4A) show that NF\u03baB transcriptional activity was strongly induced in both wild-type and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells in response to either phorbol ester or BCR stimulation. In contrast, BCR and phorbol ester-induced NF\u03baB transcriptional activity was abolished in PKC\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells (Fig. 4A), although strong activation of PKD kinases (as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 at S916) was observed in the PKC\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, PKD kinases are neither essential nor sufficient to mediate BCR-induced NF\u03baB activation in DT40 B cells and hence do not participate in DAG/PKC mediated control of NF\u03baB.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":333,"end":337},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":338,"end":339},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":351,"end":355},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":356,"end":357},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":366,"end":370},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":480,"end":484},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":485,"end":486},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":638,"end":645},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":638,"end":645},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":638,"end":645},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":646,"end":656},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":646,"end":656},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":646,"end":656},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":664,"end":667},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":669,"end":673},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":701,"end":721},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":722,"end":737},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":794,"end":798},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":799,"end":800},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":801,"end":805},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":801,"end":805},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1008},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1009,"end":1010},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1136},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1137,"end":1141},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1180},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1181,"end":1182},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1525},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1526,"end":1527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1536,"end":1540},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1620,"end":1624},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1625,"end":1626},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1635,"end":1639},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1641},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1650,"end":1654},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1844,"end":1848},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1850},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2157,"end":2161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2162,"end":2163},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2262,"end":2266},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2267,"end":2268},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":2438,"end":2442},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":2438,"end":2442},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2446,"end":2450},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2451,"end":2452},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2687,"end":2695},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":3311,"end":3327},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":3359,"end":3385},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":3386,"end":3390},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":3407,"end":3411},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":3497,"end":3501},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":3695,"end":3699},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":3700,"end":3701},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":3864,"end":3869},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":3954,"end":3973},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":3977,"end":3981},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":3985,"end":3989},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":3995,"end":4003},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":4011,"end":4016},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R12","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R15","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R19","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R21","pred":"causeOf","su
