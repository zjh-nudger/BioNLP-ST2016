Herein we describe downstream signaling pathways targeted by Foxp3 that may negatively impact retroviral pathogenesis. Overexpression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T and purified CD4+ T cells resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent decrease in basal levels of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal forkhead (FKH) domain, critical for nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity, abrogated the ability of Foxp3 to suppress NF-\u03baB activity in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat or primary human CD4+ T cells. We further demonstrate that Foxp3 suppressed the transcription of two human retroviral promoters (HIV-1 and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I [HTLV-I]) utilizing NF-\u03baB-dependent and NF-\u03baB-independent mechanisms. Examination of the latter identified the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) pathway as a target of Foxp3. Finally, comparison of the percent Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease. These results suggest an expanded role for Foxp3 in regulating NF-\u03baB- and CREB-dependent cellular and viral gene expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":6,"end":15},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":6,"end":15},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":83,"end":136},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":192,"end":197},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":330,"end":335},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":388,"end":402},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":406,"end":411},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":437,"end":440},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":498,"end":506},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":526,"end":543},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":545,"end":550},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":552,"end":562},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":564,"end":572},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":580,"end":619},"obj":"Protein_domain"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":621,"end":629},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":621,"end":629},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":634,"end":641},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":642,"end":654},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":659,"end":662},"obj":"DNA"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":663,"end":670},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":681,"end":690},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":706,"end":711},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":715,"end":723},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":724,"end":729},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":793,"end":796},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":835,"end":840},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":974,"end":979},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":994,"end":999},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1131},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1135,"end":1140},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1177,"end":1182},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1186},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1187,"end":1191},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1361,"end":1365},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1366,"end":1371},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1372,"end":1382},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1487,"end":1492},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1506},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1506},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1507,"end":1512},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R13","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T26","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T31","obj":"T30"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T30"},{"id":"R17","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"T29"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T30","obj":"T29"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T40"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R21","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T35","obj":"T34"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T34","obj":"T43"},{"id":"R23","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T43"},{"id":"R24","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T44"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T36","obj":"T45"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T37","obj":"T44"},{"id":"R27","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T45"},{"id":"R28","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T48"},{"id":"R29","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T49"},{"id":"R3","pred":"partOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T49"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T48"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
