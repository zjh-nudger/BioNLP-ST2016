(C) IB3-1 cells (5\u00d7104 cells/well) were pre-treated for 1 hour with increasing concentrations of z-YVAD-fmk (10\u201330 \u00b5M) prior to stimulation with P. aeruginosa (MOI\u200a=\u200a50). Cell culture supernatants were collected after 6 hours and assayed for IL-6 by ELISA (n\u200a=\u200a3).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":677,"end":681},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
