Briefly, 1\u00d7106 cells were stimulated overnight with anti-CD40 antibody (10 \u00b5g/ml) or an isotype control antibody, with or without 500 U/ml mouse IL-4 (BD Biosciences). RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and reverse-transcribed (Superscript III kit, Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR for GL\u03b5 and Hprt1 was performed using SYBR GREEN master mix (Applied Biosystems), and an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR instrument. Expression of GL\u03b5 in each sample was normalized to the expression of Hprt1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":25,"end":29},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":30,"end":39},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":40,"end":50},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":54,"end":57},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":58,"end":71},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":260,"end":264},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":407,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":415,"end":420},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":549,"end":559},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":563,"end":566},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":604,"end":614},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":618,"end":623},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E5"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
