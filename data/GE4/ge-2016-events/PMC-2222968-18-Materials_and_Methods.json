After 4 h, the cells were washed and activated with soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and TGF-\u03b2 (10 ng/ml). Each day, the TAT proteins were freshly added to the medium. FOXP3 expression was measured after 5 d by intracellular staining.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":4,"end":9},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":24,"end":27},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":28,"end":34},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":143,"end":148},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":251,"end":255},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":260,"end":265},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":345,"end":355},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E1"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
