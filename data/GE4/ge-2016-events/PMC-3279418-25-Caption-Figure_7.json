After 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with freshly isolated allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells (2.5\u00d7105 cells in 0.1 mL complete medium; MHC haplotype: H-2d). After 5 days, supernatants were collected and the secretion of IFN\u03b3, IL4, and IL2 were measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Samples from both negative controls had no detectable production of the aforementioned cytokines (not shown). Results are analyzed based on 2\u20134 mice per group. * P<0.05.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":467,"end":476},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":467,"end":476},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":467,"end":476},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":480,"end":484},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":486,"end":489},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":495,"end":498},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":735,"end":745},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":735,"end":745},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":735,"end":745},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M6","pred":"Negation","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
