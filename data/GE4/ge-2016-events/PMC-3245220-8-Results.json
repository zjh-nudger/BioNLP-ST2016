Among the I\u03baB molecules, I\u03baB\u03b1 is highly induced by NF-\u03baB activation [40]. Having shown that PKC regulated NF-\u03baB activity in M-CSF-stimulated MDMs, we next determined whether inhibition of PKC activity decreased expression of NF-\u03baB-regulated genes. We treated both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes and then stimulated with M-CSF. I\u03baB\u03b1 gene was measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, M-CSF enhanced I\u03baB\u03b1 gene expression and PKC inhibition by Ro-31-8220 decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 gene expression in both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells (p<0.01), demonstrating that PKC affected NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression in macrophages.\nTo further define the role of PKC in mediating human MDM survival in response to M-CSF, we examined the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-xL, which is also regulated by NF-\u03baB. As shown in Figure 6C, Ro-31-8220 reduced M-CSF-stimulated BCL-xL expression compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle control DMSO (p<0.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":161,"end":168},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":245,"end":250},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":484,"end":489},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":491,"end":495},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":557,"end":562},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":563,"end":571},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":572,"end":576},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":582,"end":592},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":626,"end":635},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":636,"end":640},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":646,"end":656},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":861,"end":866},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":884,"end":894},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":922,"end":928},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":944,"end":953},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":998,"end":1005},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1011},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1022},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1029},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1040},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1077},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
