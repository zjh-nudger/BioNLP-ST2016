Naive T cells showed detectable expression of perforin mRNA as well as perforin protein (Fig. 1, A\u2013D). Relative to its expression in naive T cells, perforin (Prf1) mRNA expression did not increase appreciably at day 2 but showed a reproducible decrease at day 4, followed by robust reexpression between days 4 and 8 (Fig. 1, A\u2013D). In contrast, granzyme B (Gzmb) mRNA was low or undetectable in naive T cells but was strongly up-regulated by day 2 after stimulation and increased progressively until day 6 (Fig. 1, A and B); similarly, granzyme B protein was expressed by day 4 and remained high until day 6 (Fig. 1 E). As expected, a small fraction of naive T cells expressed the cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF in response to stimulation, and this capacity increased significantly in differentiated cells (Fig. 1 E; see also Fig. 2 A).\nWe evaluated antigen-dependent cytolytic function in a short-term assay in which target cell death was measured within 2 h (Fig. 1 F). By limiting the duration of TCR stimulation, this strategy minimizes cytolysis secondary to new gene expression during the period of the assay. Naive T cells did not display significant cytolytic function in this short-term assay (unpublished data), most likely because they express immature (unprocessed) forms of perforin and lack the capacity to degranulate (18, 19). Even after activation for 2 or 4 d, the cells showed poor cytolytic activity (Fig. 1 F), in striking contrast to their capacity for efficient cytokine production (Fig. 1 E). Only cells cultured until day 6 displayed robust cytotoxicity, as judged by their ability to induce apoptosis in a large number of target cells (Fig. 1 F).\nThese results show that after a strong priming stimulus through TCRs and co-stimulatory receptors in vitro, granzyme B expression and the ability to produce effector cytokines are programmed early, whereas perforin expression and cytolytic function are induced later, during the phase of clonal expansion in IL-2. Therefore, the two major effector functions of CTL, cytokine production and cytolytic activity, are not intrinsically coregulated.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":9,"end":19},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":9,"end":19},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":40},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":55},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":152,"end":160},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":162,"end":172},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":187,"end":197},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":187,"end":197},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":205,"end":208},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":270,"end":280},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":270,"end":280},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":284,"end":292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":309,"end":317},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":357,"end":367},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":386,"end":394},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":396,"end":400},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":402,"end":417},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":426,"end":434},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":482,"end":490},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":520,"end":532},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":582,"end":592},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":594,"end":598},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":609,"end":628},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":663,"end":675},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":707,"end":716},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":773,"end":783},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":819,"end":832},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":904,"end":913},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":904,"end":913},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":928,"end":933},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":938,"end":941},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":988,"end":997},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":988,"end":997},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1477,"end":1484},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1517,"end":1525},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2011,"end":2021},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":2022,"end":2032},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":2109,"end":2117},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":2118,"end":2128},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":2156,"end":2163},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":2211,"end":2215},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E16","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E22","obj":"E23"},{"id":"R4","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E9"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E12"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
