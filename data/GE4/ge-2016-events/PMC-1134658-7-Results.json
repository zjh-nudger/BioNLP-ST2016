Ramos cells, which have been described to express BMP-6 mRNA endogenously [20], and the T cell line Jurkat, served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Endogenous BMP-6 mRNA levels in normal B cells were quantified by real-time RT-PCR after stimulation with anti-IgM for different time points. Interestingly, the up-regulation of BMP-6 mRNA was characteristic of an early-to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti-IgM. The level of BMP-6 mRNA was back to baseline after 24 hours upon stimulation (Figure 10). Furthermore, both FCS and human AB-serum induced significant upregulation of BMP-6 mRNA (Figure 11). Interestingly, in a separate study we have found that normal human T cells do not express BMP-6 mRNA after activation (Sivertsen et al, manuscript in preparation). Next, we wanted to detect BMP-6 protein in normal B-cells and tested various commercially available antibodies. However, in our hands these anti-BMP-6 antibodies did only recognize the recombinant BMP-6 protein and not the native protein.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":6,"end":16},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":42,"end":47},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":201,"end":208},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":209,"end":214},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":275,"end":282},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":283,"end":288},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":408,"end":413},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":558,"end":571},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":575,"end":580},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":661,"end":673},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":730,"end":735},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":745,"end":761},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":848,"end":855},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":868,"end":880},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":884,"end":889},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":990,"end":997},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":998,"end":1003},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1222},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1252},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1274},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E9"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Negation","obj":"E10"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
