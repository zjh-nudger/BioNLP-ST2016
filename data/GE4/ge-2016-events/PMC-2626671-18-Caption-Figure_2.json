(A) IFN-\u03b3 expression by WT (Tbx21+/+) and T-bet\u2013deficient (Tbx21\u2212/\u2212) T cells. Naive CD8+ T cells, or cells activated and cultured for 4 or 6 d, were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 6 h, and IFN-\u03b3 expression was assessed by intracellular staining. Numbers show the percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ cells. (B) Northern blot analysis of Prf1 and GzmB mRNA expression in WT or T-bet\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells activated and either left uninfected (uninf) or transduced with retroviruses expressing Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP). Total cellular RNA was analyzed on day 6 of culture. The frequency of transduced cells in the cultures was equivalent for both constructs (\u223c65\u201370% GFP+ cells; not depicted). (C) Granzyme B and IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tbx21+/+ and Tbx21\u2212/\u2212 T cells analyzed in restimulated cells that had been cultured for 5 d. (D) IFN-\u03b3 production by cells transduced with Eo-VP16 or control (GFP) retroviruses (RV) measured on day 4 after 6 h of restimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Numbers show the percentage of GFP+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells. Results are representative of three (A and C) or two (B and D) independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":24,"end":34},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":40,"end":45},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":46,"end":56},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":46,"end":56},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":46,"end":56},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":60,"end":65},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":70,"end":75},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":105,"end":110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":111,"end":121},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":129,"end":134},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":143,"end":148},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":149,"end":158},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":160,"end":165},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":185,"end":188},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":299,"end":304},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":305,"end":315},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":387,"end":392},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":431,"end":435},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":440,"end":444},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":445,"end":460},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":445,"end":460},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":470,"end":475},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":476,"end":485},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":486,"end":489},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":576,"end":586},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":587,"end":597},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":599,"end":606},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":625,"end":628},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":823,"end":833},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":838,"end":843},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":844,"end":854},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":844,"end":854},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":858,"end":863},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":871,"end":876},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":955,"end":960},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":961,"end":971},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":997,"end":1004},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1020},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1140,"end":1143},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1145,"end":1150},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R3","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E10"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E12"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E13"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E14"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E17"},{"id":"M6","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E18"},{"id":"M7","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E19"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
