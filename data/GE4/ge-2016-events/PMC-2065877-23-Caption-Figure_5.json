Mouse lymphoma cell lines 967 and K46\u03bc were used as controls. Expression levels were quantified with a phosphorimager and values were normalized to the ribosomal housekeeping gene L32. The cytokine:L32 ratio was set to 1 in the mouse B cell lymphoma line 967.\n(B and C) Immunoblot analysis of activated pStat3 in purified B cells (CD19+) from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice (B) at the time of harvest, and (C) 4 h after culture with or without IL10, a neutralizing antibody to IL10, or a rat IgG1 isotype control. (C) Shown are the results for WT lymphoma 1 and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 1. Arrows indicate the positions of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms of Stat3. Actin was used as a loading control.\n(D) Immunohistochemistry detection of activated nuclear pStat3 in the spleens of WT and LMP1 transgenic mice.
