RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed and cDNA was analyzed for the expression of cytokines and transcription factors by real-time PCR assay as before (Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006). Target gene mRNA expression was quantified either with SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) or with Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to ubiquitin or HPRT mRNA levels, respectively.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":104,"end":107},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":128,"end":132},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":500,"end":509},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":513,"end":517},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":518,"end":529},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":518,"end":529},"obj":"Transcription"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
