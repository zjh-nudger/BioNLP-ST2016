This concentration is close to peak plasma levels obtained from asthmatic patients treated with inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) [27]. Inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) treatment of seven steroid-naive asthma patients significantly reduced GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 interaction in vivo in a time-dependent manner. This produced a >90% decrease in GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association at 2 h (median [95% CI], 13,494 [6,828\u201317,829] versus 879 [597\u20131,165]; p<0.05 Friedman's analysis). However, this did not reach significance using Wilcoxon's post-test analysis (W\u200a=\u200a6.00) probably due to low numbers of participants. Similar results were observed when GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association was measured (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower dose of FP (100 \u00b5g) was not effective. The attenuated interaction of GATA-3 did not result from the defective recycling of importin-\u03b1, as a significant decrease in the abundance of importin-\u03b1 in the cytoplasmic pool was not detected (Figure 6E).\nWe further examined whether inhaled FP could affect cellular localization of GATA-3 in peripheral blood T cells. Treatment with inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) for 2 h significantly increased GR nuclear translocation (Figure 7A) and concomitantly decreased the number of nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactive peripheral blood T cells (37%\u00b14.2% versus 58.2%\u00b14.95%, p\u200a=\u200a0.016, W\u200a=\u200a28.0, Wilcoxon's rank test) compared with placebo as measured by immunocytochemistry (Figure 7A and 7B). This was confirmed by Western blotting, which also indicated that this effect was both time- and dose-dependent (Figure 7C and 7D). Thus, inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) induced significant loss in nuclear GATA-3 at 2 h (median [95% CI], 0.40 [0.27\u20130.53] versus 0.14 [0.11\u20130.19], p<0.05, W\u200a=\u200a21.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7C) and cytoplasmic GATA-3 levels were enhanced by inhaled FP in a dose-dependent manner (median [95% CI], 0.0032 [0.0026\u20130.0039] versus 0.658 [0.592\u20130.720], p<0.05, W\u200a=\u200a\u221221.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7D). In addition, FP (500 \u00b5g) inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation in primary T cells in vivo at 2 h in samples from two patients (Figure 7E).\nTaken together, our data suggest that inhaled FP reduces nuclear localization of GATA-3 in vivo by acutely inhibiting phospho-GATA-3\u2013importin association. This effect may be direct, through competition for importin-\u03b1 or associated molecules, or secondary to an effect on p38 MAPK-mediated GATA-3 phosphorylation via rapid induction of MKP-1. The combination of these two interacting effects can result in complete suppression of GATA-3 nuclear import and thus Th2 cytokine gene expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":4,"end":14},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":51,"end":58},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":59,"end":71},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":172,"end":181},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":182,"end":190},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":205,"end":216},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":225,"end":232},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":233,"end":239},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":334,"end":343},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":412,"end":422},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":535,"end":545},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":535,"end":545},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":546,"end":550},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":555,"end":557},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":563,"end":573},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":563,"end":573},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":578,"end":588},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":593,"end":604},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":608,"end":614},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":860,"end":867},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":868,"end":874},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":886,"end":897},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":916,"end":925},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":939,"end":947},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":955,"end":963},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":967,"end":973},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":985,"end":996},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1265,"end":1271},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1283,"end":1294},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1381,"end":1391},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1392,"end":1403},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1407,"end":1413},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1629,"end":1635},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1645,"end":1657},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1661,"end":1667},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1754,"end":1763},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1764,"end":1766},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1767,"end":1774},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1775,"end":1788},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1851,"end":1857},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":2206,"end":2213},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":2226,"end":2230},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":2234,"end":2241},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2242,"end":2248},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2373,"end":2384},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2385,"end":2391},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":2392,"end":2398},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":2404,"end":2412},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":2437,"end":2446},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":2763,"end":2770},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":2771,"end":2778},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":2779,"end":2791},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2795,"end":2801},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E35","span":{"begin":2821,"end":2831},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2840,"end":2846},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E36","span":{"begin":2856,"end":2867},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E37","span":{"begin":2994,"end":3002},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":3003,"end":3009},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E38","span":{"begin":3010,"end":3025},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E39","span":{"begin":3036,"end":3045},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":3049,"end":3054},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E40","span":{"begin":3097,"end":3104},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E41","span":{"begin":3128,"end":3139},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":3143,"end":3149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":3150,"end":3157},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E42","span":{"begin":3158,"end":3164},"obj":"Localization"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E16","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R19","pred
