We found that stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with heat-killed PAO1 produced the highest levels of NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activation (Fig. 6a) and this correlated with IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) but negligible amounts of IL-1\u03b2 were secreted (Fig. 6c). Stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with live PAO1 did not significantly increase NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity (Fig. 6a) or IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) over priming alone. However, IL-1\u03b2 production was greatly augmented over primed cells stimulated with heat-killed PAO1 or unprimed cells stimulated with live PAO1 (Fig. 6c). This confirmed that NF-\u03baB activation alone is not sufficient for maximal IL-1\u03b2 secretion, but increased priming of NF-\u03baB is capable of augmenting IL-1\u03b2 production and secretion upon inflammasome stimulation. Dependency of these responses on NF-\u03baB was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition of NF-\u03baB using the Bay11-7082 inhibitor of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, which significantly reduced NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activation (P<0.001) (Fig. 6d) and the subsequent production of IL-8 (P<0.01) (Fig. 6e) and IL-1\u03b2 (P<0.001) (Fig. 6f) in response to both heat-killed and live PAO1. These results were also verified in CF and control PBMCs for each inflammasome examined (P<0.001) (Fig. 6g\u2013h). Overall these results confirm that NF-\u03baB is an important modulator of IL-1\u03b2 production and that increased activation of NF-\u03baB augments inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1\u03b2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":20,"end":28},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":48,"end":57},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":92,"end":102},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":111,"end":118},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":119,"end":124},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":134,"end":144},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":467,"end":472},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":478,"end":486},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":674,"end":679},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":680,"end":690},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":703,"end":712},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":869,"end":879},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":892,"end":897},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":898,"end":907},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":965,"end":970},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1147},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1155},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1171},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1200},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1272},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1309},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1344},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1545,"end":1554},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1558,"end":1563},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1564,"end":1574},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1614,"end":1622},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1636,"end":1644},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1645,"end":1655},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1664},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E19","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E20","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E6"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
