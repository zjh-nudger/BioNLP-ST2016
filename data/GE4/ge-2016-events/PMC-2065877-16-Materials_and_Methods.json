PCR reactions contained 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 \u03bcM each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (NEB) performed in 1X ThermoPol buffer (NEB). Primers used were V\u03bacon and J\u03ba5\u20131\u00b0 and have been described previously [74]. PCR conditions were 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 63 \u00b0C for 90 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 1 cycle of 72 \u00b0C for 5 min.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":224,"end":242},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
