Each bar represents the mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments; *** p<0.001 compared with control as determined by ANOVA/Newman-Keuls analysis. (C and D) Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of PBMCs from steroid-na\u00efve asthma patients treated with inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g via a spacer) in vivo demonstrated decreased association between GATA-3 and importin-\u03b1. The individual values for each treatment are presented graphically. (E) Representative Western blot showing that importin-\u03b1 expression was unaffected by inhalation of FP. Blot is representative of gels from three participants.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":23,"end":30},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":23,"end":30},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":37},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":38,"end":49},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":76},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":77,"end":84},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":85,"end":97},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":243,"end":251},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":252,"end":263},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":272,"end":278},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":623,"end":632},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":633,"end":644},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":653,"end":659},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E8"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
