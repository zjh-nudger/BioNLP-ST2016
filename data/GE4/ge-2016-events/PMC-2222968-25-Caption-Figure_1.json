Cells were harvested after 5 days and FOXP3 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of 4 independent experiments.\n(B) In vitro differentiated Th1, Th2, or iTreg cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28, TGF-\u03b2, or anti-IL-4 as indicated. The phenotype of these cells was confirmed by FACS and proliferation analysis (Figure S1).
