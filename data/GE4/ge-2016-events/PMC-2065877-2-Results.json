It has previously been shown that in these transgenic mice, LMP1 expression was restricted to B220+ B cells with lymphoma detected in greatly enlarged spleens [23,26]. To investigate whether LMP1 expression contributes to lymphoma development, B cells were purified from splenocytes by positive selection using anti-CD19 MACS magnetic beads, and equivalent amounts of B cells were analyzed by immunoblotting. LMP1 was detectable in LMP1 transgenic B cells, but upon development of lymphoma, LMP1 expression was stronger in 5/7 lymphomas analyzed with concomitant appearance of degradation products (Figure 1A). To determine whether the higher level of LMP1 detected was due to an expansion of malignant lymphocytes, expression of LMP1 in the spleen was further evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Immunohistochemistry analysis of spleen sections detected LMP1 in the plasma membrane of cells in both the follicular white pulp and circulating lymphocytes in the red pulp (Figure 1B). LMP1 expression was heterogeneous with strong LMP1 staining interspersed amongst a background of cells staining weakly for LMP1. Upon development to lymphoma, LMP1 expression was more abundantly detected with multiple foci of intense LMP1 staining. This demonstrates that the increased LMP1 detected by immunoblotting upon malignant progression reflects an increase in LMP1 expression and an accumulation of cells expressing high levels of LMP1. This correlation between high LMP1 expression and the development of lymphoma suggests that progression to lymphoma results from increased levels of LMP1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":11},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":15,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":20,"end":30},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":75,"end":79},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":80,"end":90},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":130,"end":147},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":253,"end":257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":258,"end":268},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":273,"end":283},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":384,"end":388},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":389,"end":399},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":509,"end":513},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":602,"end":606},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":611,"end":621},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":625,"end":629},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":684,"end":688},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":689,"end":699},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":704,"end":712},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":829,"end":841},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":845,"end":849},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":909,"end":919},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":923,"end":927},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1054},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1055,"end":1059},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1187},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1198},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1222,"end":1228},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1229,"end":1233},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1295,"end":1301},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1306,"end":1310},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1342,"end":1346},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1347,"end":1357},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1367,"end":1377},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1409,"end":1416},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1417,"end":1421},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1468},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1469,"end":1473},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1540,"end":1548},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1552,"end":1556},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1557,"end":1567},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1597,"end":1607},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1608,"end":1619},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1623,"end":1627},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1654,"end":1658},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1663},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1664,"end":1674},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1758,"end":1767},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1768,"end":1774},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1778,"end":1782},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E22","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E23"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E23","obj":"E24"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E26","obj":"E25"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E26"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E28","obj":"E27"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E28"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E12"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E16"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.
