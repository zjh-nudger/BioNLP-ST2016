Transgenic DO11.10 mice, expressing a T cell receptor for OVA323\u2013339 peptide in the context of H-2d, were backcrossed with mice expressing GATA-3, driven by the human CD2 locus control region (CD2-GATA3) [22], resulting in DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 mice. Mice used for experiments were backcrossed on a BALB/c background for a minimum of eight generations and used at an age of 8\u201312 wk. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal studies were performed according to institutional and state guidelines.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-events","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":215,"end":225},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":226,"end":232},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":254,"end":257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":284,"end":289},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":318,"end":321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":322,"end":327},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
