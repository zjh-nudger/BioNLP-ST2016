I\u03baB\u03b1 (C-21, sc-371), p65 (C-20, sc-372), and phospho-threonine (H-2, sc-5267) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; \u03b2-actin (AC-15, A5441), Flag (M2, F3165), HA (HA-7, H3663), importin-\u03b1 (IM-75, I1784), and importin-\u03b2 (31H4, I2534) antibodies were from Sigma; PARP (C2-10, 556362), IKK\u03b1 (B78-1, 556532), and IKK\u03b2 (24, 611254) antibodies were from BD Pharmingen; CK2\u03b1 (31, 611610) and Hsp90 (68, 610418) antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories; phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 (5A5, 9246S) and phospho-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (16A6, 2697S) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology; phospho-serine (AB1603) and phospho-tyrosine (4G10, 05-777) antibodies were from Millipore. The rabbit polyclonal RPS3 antiserum was as described previously6. The rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for S209 phosphorylated RPS3 was generated and affinity purified by Primm Biotech using the peptide NH2-CKPLPDHV(Sp)IVE-COOH.","project":"pmc-enju-pas"}
