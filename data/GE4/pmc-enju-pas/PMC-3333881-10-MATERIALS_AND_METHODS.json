After 10\u2009min, ice-cold PBS plus 0.125\u2009M glycine was added, and plates were transferred on ice, washed extensively with PBS, and scraped. After centrifugation, cells were 10\u2009min lysed in lysis buffer (5\u2009mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85\u2009mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with 1\u00d7 Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Diagnostic GmbH). Nuclei were pelletted (1000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 5\u2009min), and resuspended in sonication buffer (50\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 10\u2009mM EDTA). Chromatin was sonicated using Bandelin Sonoplus GM70 (Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany), centrifuged (14\u2009000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 15\u2009min), and supernatant was 10-fold diluted in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 16.7\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 1.1% Triton X-100, 167\u2009mM NaCl, 1.2\u2009mM EDTA). Samples were pre-cleared by 3-h incubation with 20\u2009\u00b5l of protein G agarose beads followed by incubation with antibodies against the analysed proteins. Primary antibodies were: anti-p65 (sc-372), anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 (sc-203) and rabbit IgG (sc-2027) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-FLAG M2 from Sigma\u2013Aldrich. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4\u00b0C overnight and immune complexes were collected with protein G agarose beads, washed five times with low salt buffer (20\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 150\u2009mM NaCl), four times with high salt buffer (20\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 500\u2009mM NaCl), once with TE buffer (10\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 1\u2009mM EDTA), and extracted in TE buffer containing 2% SDS. Protein\u2013DNA cross-links were reverted by heating at 65\u00b0C overnight. DNA was further purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and eluted in 50\u2009\u00b5l sterile distilled water. Specific enrichment in NF-\u03baB enhancer sequences was measured by real-time PCR of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) eluates using SYBR GreenER Master Mix (Invitrogen). Reactions were carried out with the iCycler iQ Real-Time detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the following conditions: 95\u00b0C, 1\u2009min; (94\u00b0C, 10\u2009s; 60\u00b0C, 30\u2009s) \u00d740. Primers used for MIP-1\u03b1, GAPDH and ACTB are listed in Supplementary Data. Real-time PCR of CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2 were performed using the Custom ChIP array (QIAGEN). For each sample, values were normalized to input DNA and reported as % of input over the rabbit IgG control.","project":"pmc-enju-pas"}
