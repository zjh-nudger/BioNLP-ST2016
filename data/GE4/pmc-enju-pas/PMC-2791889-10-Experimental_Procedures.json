Female mice were used at 8\u201312 weeks old, and animal protocols were approved according to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, Home Office, UK. Reagents, including antibodies for T\u00a0cell and DC preparation, purification and culture, media, cytokines, and cytokine mAbs have been described (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006; Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2009; Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2006). LPS (S. minnesota) was from Alexis, chicken ovalbumin protein (OVA protein) was from from Sigma-Aldrich, and ovalbumin peptide323-339 (OVA) (endotoxin-free) was from Biosynthesis. U0126 was from BioMol International. PD184352 (MEK inhibitors), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), and CT99021 (GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor) were kind gifts from P. Cohen and N.\u00a0Shpiro, University of Dundee, UK.","project":"pmc-enju-pas"}
