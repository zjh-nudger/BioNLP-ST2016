Jurkat cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009107) were transfected with siRNA Tat or siRNA control (2\u2009nmol), or left untransfected; 24\u2009h later, cells were infected with HXB2-pseudotyped NL4-3.Luc.R\u2212E\u2212 virions (500\u2009ng of p24) and harvested at the indicated time. (A) Tat expression was measured in total RNA by real-time PCR, while the luciferase activity was measured in whole cell extracts. (B) Nuclear extracts (10\u2009\u00b5g) were analysed for the p65 and p50 binding to the NF-\u03baB double-stranded oligonucleotide using the NF-\u03baB Transcription Factor ELISA Assay kit (Cayman). (C) The expression of p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 was analysed by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and western blotting of nuclear or cytosolic extracts (20\u2009\u00b5g) using anti-p65 and anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibodies. Histone H1 and Hexokinase II were detected with specific antibodies as markers of nuclear and cytosolic extracts, respectively. Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (mock). (D) IKK activity was measured in cytosolic extracts (100\u2009\u00b5g) by using HTScan IKK Kinase Assay (Cell Signaling Technology). Values (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093) are shown.","project":"pmc-enju-pas"}
