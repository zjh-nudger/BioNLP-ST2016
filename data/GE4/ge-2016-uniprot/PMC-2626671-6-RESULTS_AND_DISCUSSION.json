We isolated CD8+ T cells from Runx3\u2212/\u2212 (KO) mice of the outbred ICR background and their WT Runx3+/+ littermates by positive selection with anti-CD8 magnetic beads (Figs. S1 and S2, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081242/DC1). Strikingly, Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to differentiate into effector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3). Compared with WT T cells, perforin mRNA and protein expression were essentially undetectable in Runx3\u2212/\u2212 T cells at day 6 of culture (Fig. 3, A and B). Runx3\u2212/\u2212 T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T-bet expression was unimpaired (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN-\u03b3, but not TNF or IL-2, by CD8+ T cells restimulated at day 6 (Fig. 3 C).\nWe previously reported that Th1 cell differentiation was regulated through a feed-forward loop in which T-bet is up-regulated early and induces Runx3, after which T-bet and Runx3 cooperate to induce IFN-\u03b3 and silence IL-4, thus promoting stable differentiation toward the Th1 lineage (15, 22). Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction (Fig. 3 A), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression (Fig. 2), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet\u2013deficient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-\u03b3 expression (Fig. 2, B and D), we asked whether CTL differentiation was also potentially regulated by a feed-forward loop involving these same two classes of Runx and T-box transcription factors. Specifically, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-\u03b3, and granzyme B.\nTo test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to ask whether Eomes and Runx3 bound regulatory regions of the Prf1, Ifng, and Gzmb genes (Fig. 3 D). Both proteins associated with gene regulatory regions in differentiated CTLs. Runx3 bound to the Prf1 and Gzmb transcription start sites (TSS); to a known IL-2 responsive enhancer located near \u22121 kb of the Prf1 gene (23); to the distal CTL-specific DNase I hypersensitive site 9 in the Prf1 locus (24); to the Ifng promoter near the TSS, as previously reported for Th1 cells (10); and to several DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Ifng locus (Fig. 3 D and not depicted) (25). Eomes bound primarily to the Prf1 TSS and the \u22121 kb enhancer; this binding was substantially greater than that observed at the promoter of the Il2rb gene, a known direct target of Eomes (8), and comparable to that observed at the Ifng TSS, a known target of T-box proteins in both Th1 and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3 D) (17).\nTo determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL effector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo-VP16 in CD8+ T cells from Runx3\u2212/\u2212 mice. Because of the limited number of CD8+ T cells in these mice, and because we saw no difference between Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+CD4\u2212 SP and CD8+CD4+ DP cells in our previous experiments, we used total Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells without further fractionation as recipients for retroviral transduction. Reconstitution of Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells with Runx3 restored expression of Eomes as well as perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, Runx3\u2212/\u2212 T cells showed a compensatory up-regulation of Runx1, which was suppressed upon reconstitution with Runx3, indicating that Runx1 is a target of repression by Runx3. Notably, Eo-VP16 did not up-regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3\u2212/\u2212 cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN-\u03b3 expression upon TCR restimulation (Fig. 4, A and B). This result suggests strongly that perforin expression requires Runx3 and Eomes.\nAs expected from their defect in perforin and granzyme B expression, Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells showed defective cytolytic activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (12). However, TCR-stimulated Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ cells were as effective as WT cells in killing tumor cells in a redirected CTL assay (12). Furthermore, CD8+ cells from the peritoneal cavity of Runx3\u2212/\u2212 mice immunized with certain tumor cells effectively killed these targets (13). Therefore, although activation of the perforin/granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas\u2013Fas ligand pathway.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":97,"end":102},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":151,"end":154},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":151,"end":154},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":184,"end":189},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":190,"end":195},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":274,"end":279},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":325,"end":328},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":325,"end":328},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":343,"end":348},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":405,"end":410},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":458,"end":461},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":458,"end":461},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":575,"end":580},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":584,"end":587},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":584,"end":587},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":701,"end":709},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":711,"end":721},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":727,"end":732},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":769,"end":777},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":839,"end":844},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":895,"end":900},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":935,"end":940},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":966,"end":971},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1028},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1073},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1083,"end":1086},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1094},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1102},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1102},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1255},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1290,"end":1295},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1309,"end":1314},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1319,"end":1324},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1345,"end":1350},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1363,"end":1367},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1452,"end":1457},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1481,"end":1486},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1529,"end":1534},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1566,"end":1574},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1622,"end":1629},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1646,"end":1651},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1697,"end":1705},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1710,"end":1715},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1873,"end":1877},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1873,"end":1877},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1873,"end":1877},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1942,"end":1947},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":1973,"end":1978},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2011,"end":2016},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2071,"end":2079},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2081,"end":2086},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":2092,"end":2102},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":2196,"end":2201},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":2206,"end":2211},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":2244,"end":2248},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":2250,"end":2254},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":2260,"end":2264},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":2361,"end":2366},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":2380,"end":2384},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":2389,"end":2393},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":2438,"end":2442},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":2489,"end":2493},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":2569,"end":2573},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":2593,"end":2597},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":2715,"end":2719},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":2760,"end":2765},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":2789,"end":2793},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":2940,"end":2945},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":2990,"end":2994},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":3049,"end":3052},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":3049,"end":3052},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":3100,"end":3105},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin":3179,"end":3184},"ob
