The addition PTX to LPS-stimulated cells resulted in a reduction in TNF-\u03b1, similar to that observed in our previous experiments (529 pg/mL \u00b1 112 vs. 37 pg/mL \u00b1 10; P < 0.01). Pre-incubation of cells with H89 prior to LPS and PTX exposure did not result in any significant modulation of TNF-\u03b1 production when compared to that demonstrated with PTX alone (P = 0.2; Figure 5). These results suggest that downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 production by PTX in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells is, at least in part, PKA-independent.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":20},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":22},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":117,"end":122},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":117,"end":120},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":339,"end":342},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":557,"end":560},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":557,"end":562},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":690,"end":693},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":690,"end":695},"obj":"P01375"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
