(B) Western blot analysis showing that FP (10\u22128 M) does not affect whole-cell GATA-3 degradation over 17 h. (C) GFP-tagged GATA-3 is overexpressed and cells stimulated (b\u2013j) or not (a) with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of treating cells with FP (10\u22128 M, f\u2013j) after 30 min stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 is also shown. (D) FP (10\u22128 M) does not prevent anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated p65 nuclear translocation at 60 min after stimulation. **p<0.01 compared to unstimulated cells. All results are representative of at least four independent experiments and are shown as mean\u00b1SEM. Results were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":39,"end":45},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":213,"end":217},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":229,"end":235},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":348,"end":351},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":348,"end":351},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":348,"end":351},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":348,"end":351},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":352,"end":356},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":453,"end":459},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":487,"end":490},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":498,"end":504},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":570,"end":573},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":570,"end":573},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":570,"end":573},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":570,"end":573},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":574,"end":578},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":666,"end":669},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":666,"end":669},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":666,"end":669},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":666,"end":669},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":670,"end":674},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":728,"end":731},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":728,"end":731},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":728,"end":731},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":728,"end":731},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":732,"end":736},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":748,"end":751},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":748,"end":751},"obj":"P21579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
