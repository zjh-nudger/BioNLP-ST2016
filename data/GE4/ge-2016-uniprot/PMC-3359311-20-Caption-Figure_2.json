Cells were primed with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours where appropriate. Cell culture supernatants were assayed for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 production by ELISA. Insert shows IL-8 secretion in response to stimulation with IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng/ml).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":287,"end":292},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":474,"end":479},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":484,"end":488},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":523,"end":527},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":570,"end":575},"obj":"P01584"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
