The NF-\u03baB 3\u2032 biotin end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide used as a probe for the EMSA was a 42-bp double stranded construct (5\u2032-TTGTTACAA-GGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGC \u2013 3\u2032) containing two tandemly repeated NF-\u03baB binding sites (underlined). Specificity was determined by a competition assay with the addition of 200 molar excess of unlabeled double stranded NF-\u03baB oligonucleotide. The CREB 3\u2032 biotin end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide used as a probe for the EMSA was a 23-bp double stranded construct (5\u2032-TTT TCG AGC TCTGACGTCAGA-GC \u2013 3\u2032) containing the CRE consensus sequence (underlined). Specificity was determined by a competition assay with the addition of 200 molar excess of unlabeled double stranded CREB oligonucleotide.\nNuclear extracts (10 \u03bcg) were incubated with 5 nM NF-\u03baB or CREB probe (NF-kB: 1x binding buffer, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP40, 10% glycerol, and 50 ng/\u03bcl poly dI-dC, CREB: 1x binding buffer, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.10% NP40, 6% glycerol, 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 50 ng/\u03bcl poly dI-dC) and were then electrophoresed through a 6% DNA retardation gel at 100V for 90 minutes. The gels were electrophoretically transferred at 380mA for 1 hour on ice to a positively charged nylon membrane and immediately cross-linked for 15 minutes with a UV transilluminator equipped with a 312 nm bulb. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the LightShift Chemiluminescent Substrate were used to detect the biotin end-labeled DNA. The nylon membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 1\u20133 minutes for detection.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":14},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":10,"end":14},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":10,"end":14},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":10,"end":14},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":10,"end":14},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":10,"end":14},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":545,"end":549},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":545,"end":549},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":545,"end":549},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":545,"end":551},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":545,"end":549},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":545,"end":549},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":545,"end":549},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":712,"end":715},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":947,"end":951},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":947,"end":951},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":947,"end":951},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":947,"end":951},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":947,"end":951},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":947,"end":951},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1071},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1071},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1071},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1071},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1071},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1067,"end":1071},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1106},"obj":"P0A7Z4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
