PDE inhibitors have been shown to downregulate TNF-\u03b1 production in distinct human cell populations. We have previously shown that, in general, TNF-\u03b1 levels continue to increase after LPS exposure and that concomitant infusion of phosphodiesterase inhibitors can markedly decrease TNF-\u03b1 levels.18\u201319 In this in vitro study, we verified the sustained attenuation of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 expression over time in an isolated human mononuclear cell population.\nThe mechanisms by which PTX, a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, significantly and consistently decreases TNF-\u03b1 production have not been completely elucidated. It has been postulated that drugs that increase intracellular cAMP exert their anti-inflammatory effects through the activation of PKA. This classic pathway has been challenged as the sole mechanism involved in the modulation of inflammation by cAMP-enhancing drugs, and alternative mechanisms involving PKA-independent pathways have been proposed.6\u20138 In this series of experiments, we observed a significant attenuation of TNF-\u03b1 production in LPS-stimulated human mononuclear cells following PTX administration, independent of PKA activation.\nWe used a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, PTX, in the present study because it has been used clinically in the treatment of a variety of conditions in which inflammation is an important component of the pathophysiology of the disease process.19 Additionally, the use of PTX in sepsis as an adjunct to other treatments to maintain adequate organ function has been explored based upon its effects on TNF-\u03b1 synthesis. However, the reported beneficial effects of PTX are not only related to the downregulation of TNF-\u03b1but also to PTX\u2019s hemorrheologic properties, its ability to reduce neutrophil activation, and its beneficial effects on microcirculation, cardiac performance, and organ injury.20\u201325 Herein, we demonstrated that the downregulatory effects of PTX in human mononuclear cells involves modulation of pathways that involve NF-\u03baB and CREB, two major transcription factors involved in the inflammatory cascade.\nNF-\u03baB/Rel constitutes a family of transcriptional factors involved in the regulation of numerous cytokine genes and immune responses in different cell populations. The most abundant form of NF-\u03baB is the p50\u2013p65 heterodimer.26 The inactive form of NF-\u03baB exists in the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitory complex containing I-\u03baB\u03b1. Following cellular stimulation with LPS and chemotactic factors, NF-\u03baB inducible kinase phosphorylates and activates the I-\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex consisting of IKK-1 and IKK-2, which in turn phosphorylates the I-\u03baB\u03b1 subunit. Phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of I-\u03baB\u03b1 results in NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. This allows the transcription factor to bind to promoter regions of specific pro-inflammatory genes and influence transcription.27,28 Because a number of potential \u03baB sites are present in the nucleotide sequences of the TNF-\u03b1 gene, NF-\u03baB is considered to be a critical transcriptional factor involved in TNF-\u03b1 gene expression and protein synthesis.29,30\nIn this set of experiments, we demonstrated that PTX downregulates cytoplasmic I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation/translocation, as well as NF-\u03baB DNA-binding after LPS stimulation, suggesting that PTX exerts its function proximal to or at the level of I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation.\nPrevious studies that have evaluated the effects of cAMP-elevating drugs on I-\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB have reported conflicting results. Haddad et al. reported results similar to ours with respect to the effects of PTX on I-\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB in pulmonary epithelial cells.31 Conversely, Neumann et al. proposed that increased intracellular cAMP stabilizes the interaction between I-\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB, therefore reducing NF-\u03baB activation.32 In contrast, Takahashi et al. showed no difference in I-\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in Jurkat T-lymphocytes in the presence and absence of forskolin, an alternative cAMP inducing compound. This group also demonstrated that forskolin did not inhibit the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB and that CREB was not involved in forskolin-induced decrease in p65 transcriptional activity.33 Similar results were reported by Ollivier et al. using THP-1 cells and endothelial cells treated with forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP, two agents known to function through cAMP elevation and subsequent PKA activation.9 The differences between our results and those mentioned above may be explained by the use of different cell types and exogenous stimulants. It is also possible that PTX exerts its anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-\u03baB pathway independent of PKA, as suggested by the continued attenuation of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 production by PTX in the presence or absence of PKA inhibition observed in this study. This hypothesis is currently under investigation in our laboratory. Furthermore, we utilized a broad PKA inhibitor in this study in addition to H89, but did not examine the effect of specific inhibition of various PKA isoforms. This information may yield more insight into the mechanism by which PTX exerts its down-regulatory effects.\nPDE inhibitors may also downregulate NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity by altering the competitive binding of CREB and NF-\u03baB to the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory genes. Herein, we showed that the activation and DNA binding activity of CREB is upregulated in a dose\u2013dependent manner by PTX. Of note, the increase in CREB activity was slightly alleviated by the addition of LPS, suggesting competition between PTX-induced CREB-associated gene transcription and those factors, such as NF-\u03baB, which may be upregulated by LPS exposure. This competition has been postulated to involve the recruitment of the co-activator CBP and its homologue p30034, suggesting an alternative mechanism that may be involved in the anti-inflammatory actions of PTX. Future studies are planned to delineate the validity of this potential mechanism.\nThe effects of PTX on other transcription factors, such as AP-1, c-fos, and c-jun, cannot be ruled out by our experiments. Activation of AP-1 and its components (c-fos and c-jun) by agents that enhance mononuclear cell activity has been implicated in TNF-\u03b1 expression. Moreover, AP-1 and CREB recognize a similar DNA binding sequence in the promoter region of the TNF-\u03b1 gene35. Given these relationships, it is conceivable that PTX may exert some of its anti-inflammatory actions by affecting AP-1 activation and favoring CREB binding, thus inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 gene transcription. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the complex interactions between CREB, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1 following LPS exposure and PDE inhibition. Furthermore, the effect of PTX on the cGMP pathway after LPS stimulation has not been explored, although we plan to do so in the future.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that PDE inhibition of human mononuclear cells downregulates TNF-\u03b1 production, at least in part, through a PKA-independent mechanism. In addition, PTX attenuates the activity of NF-B while upregulating CREB activation after LPS stimulation, which may result in modulation of pro-inflammatory mediator synthesis. Therefore, PTX may serve as a potential adjunct therapeutic for the treatment of conditions in which TNF-\u03b1 production plays a significant role.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":220,"end":223},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":220,"end":225},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":460,"end":463},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":460,"end":465},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":686,"end":691},"obj":"P26358"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":706,"end":709},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":706,"end":711},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":813,"end":816},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":813,"end":818},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":909,"end":912},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":909,"end":914},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1049},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1051},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1145},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1147},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1333,"end":1336},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1333,"end":1338},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1811,"end":1814},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1811,"end":1816},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":2338,"end":2341},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":2338,"end":2343},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":2449,"end":2452},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":2781,"end":2785},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":2781,"end":2785},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":2781,"end":2785},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":2781,"end":2785},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":2781,"end":2785},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":2781,"end":2785},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":2863,"end":2866},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":3060,"end":3063},"obj":"P19838"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":3064,"end":3067},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":3064,"end":3067},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":3738,"end":3741},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":3738,"end":3743},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":3822,"end":3825},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":3822,"end":3827},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":3988,"end":3991},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":3988,"end":3991},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":4871,"end":4875},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":4871,"end":4875},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":4871,"end":4875},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":4871,"end":4875},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":4871,"end":4875},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":4871,"end":4875},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":4926,"end":4929},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":4926,"end":4929},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":5477,"end":5480},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":5477,"end":5482},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":6013,"end":6017},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":6013,"end":6017},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":6013,"end":6017},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":6013,"end":6017},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":6013,"end":6017},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":6013,"end":6017},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":6145,"end":6149},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":6145,"end":6149},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":6145,"end":6149},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":6145,"end":6149},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":6145,"end":6149},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":6145,"end":6149},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":6225,"end":6229},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":6225,"end":6229},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":6225,"end":6229},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":6225,"end":6229},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":6225,"end":6229},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":6225,"end":6229},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":6330,"end":6334},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":6330,"end":6334},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":6330,"end":6334},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":6330,"end":6334},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":6330,"end":6334},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":6330,"end":6334},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":6525,"end":6528},"obj":"Q92793"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":6794,"end":6798},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":6811,"end":6816},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","spa
