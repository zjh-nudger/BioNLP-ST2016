Fig. S2 shows decreased RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNA and protein expression after siRNA-mediated knockdown and decreased FOXP3 expression in human CD4+ T cells after RUNX1 and RUNX3 knockdown. Fig. S3 shows the quantification of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-\u03b3 levels in control siRNA transfected or RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA transfected human CD4+ T cells. Fig. S4 shows the putative RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 core promoter sequence of human, mouse, and rat. Fig. S5 shows the induction of FOXP3 protein after overexpression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 in human CD4+ T cells. Fig. S6 shows that endogenous IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 do not effect Foxp3 expression in naive CD4+ T cells of CbfbF/F CD4-cre and CbfbF/F control mice, which were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs, IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2 in the absence or presence of anti-IL-4 and anti-IFN-\u03b3 neutralizing mAbs. Fig. S7 shows similar cell death (A) and proliferation (B) of Foxp3+ and Foxp3\u2212 cells in CbfbF/F CD4-cre and CbfbF/F control mice cultures.
