{"target":"http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PMC/sourceid/3245220/divs/9","sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"3245220","divid":9,"text":"Identification of PKC\u03b1 as the Upstream Activator of NF-\u03baB in Myeloid Cells\nEven though the PKC family consists of 10 members, finding that PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitors and intracellular calcium inhibitors reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity, suggested PKC\u03b1 was involved in NF-\u03baB activation after M-CSF treatment. To confirm the role of PKC\u03b1 in NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages, constructs for either wildtype (WT)-PKC\u03b1 or kinase-deficient (KD)-PKC\u03b1 was co-transfected with the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter gene and SEAP secretion was measured. As shown in Figure 7A, MDMs co-transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP and WT-PKC\u03b1 had a 1.8-fold increase in NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared with NS cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.05), similar to M-CSF-treated cells expressing only pNF-\u03baB-SEAP. Transfecting human macrophages with the KD-PKC\u03b1 construct significantly reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity compared to WT-PKC\u03b1 transfected cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.016). Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells transfected with WT-PKC\u03b1 had 2.5-fold more NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared to unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells (NS) transfected with WT-PKC\u03b1 (Figure 7B). Expression of the KD-PKC\u03b1 construct into RAW 264.7 cells reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity to 1.5-fold (p\u200a=\u200a0.045) compared to cells transfected with WT PKC\u03b1.\nCell survival was also examined in MDMs expressing either WT-PKC\u03b1 or KD-PKC\u03b1 constructs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining. As expected, M-CSF increased MDM survival as measured by the percent of Annexin V/PI negative cells. Similarly, expression of WT-PKC\u03b1 protected cells from apoptosis. In contrast, expression of KD-PKC\u03b1 decreased M-CSF-induced cell survival (p<0.01) (Figure 7C).\nNext, we examined the effect of expressing the PKC\u03b1 constructs on NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKC\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-\u03baB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276. Expression of WT-PKC\u03b1 did not effect the phosphorylation of either residue with or without M-CSF stimulation. These observations demonstrate that PKC\u03b1 is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-\u03baB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65.\nTo further validate the impact that PKC\u03b1 played in M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKC\u03b1 siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells. A pool of specific PKC\u03b1 siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF. Reducing native PKC\u03b1 expression decreased M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in both MDM (Figure 7E) (p\u200a=\u200a0.012) and Raw 264.7 cells (Figure 7F) (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKC\u03b1 siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKC\u03b1 siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p\u200a=\u200a0.047). In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKC\u03b1 siRNA transfection decreased PKC\u03b1 protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that PKC\u03b1 regulated NF-\u03baB activation and M-CSF-regulated cell survival.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":18,"end":22},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":139,"end":143},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":202,"end":207},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":204,"end":207},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":242,"end":246},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":286,"end":291},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":288,"end":291},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":326,"end":330},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":403,"end":407},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":592,"end":596},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":661,"end":666},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":663,"end":666},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":724,"end":729},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":726,"end":729},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":853,"end":858},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":855,"end":858},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":897,"end":901},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":980,"end":984},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1045},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1042,"end":1045},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1123,"end":1127},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1162,"end":1166},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1211},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1208,"end":1211},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1297,"end":1301},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1368},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1375,"end":1379},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1394,"end":1403},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1439,"end":1444},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1441,"end":1444},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1498,"end":1507},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1555,"end":1559},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1622,"end":1626},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1637,"end":1642},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1639,"end":1642},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1734,"end":1738},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1816,"end":1820},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1907,"end":1910},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1907,"end":1910},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1975,"end":1979},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":2049,"end":2054},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":2051,"end":2054},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":2104,"end":2108},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":2125,"end":2130},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":2127,"end":2130},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":2240,"end":2243},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":2240,"end":2243},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2281,"end":2285},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2296,"end":2301},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2298,"end":2301},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2359,"end":2363},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2420,"end":2424},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":2506,"end":2511},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":2508,"end":2511},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":2529,"end":2533},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":2555,"end":2560},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":2557,"end":2560},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":2726,"end":2735},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":2763,"end":2767},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":2811,"end":2816},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":2813,"end":2816},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":2880,"end":2884},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":2987,"end":2991},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":3021,"end":3025},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":3105,"end":3109},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":3141,"end":3146},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":3143,"end":3146},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
