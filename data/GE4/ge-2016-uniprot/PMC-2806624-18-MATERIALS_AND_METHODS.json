A mouse IgG1 antibody (BioLegend) was used as an isotype control. Data were analyzed with the CXP software (Beckman Coulter). Cells were cultured with IL-2, and then left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD2/-CD3/-CD28 mAb.\nFlow cytometry analyses of the mouse cells were performed on an LSRII (BD) and cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria (BD). All antibodies for these experiments were purchased from eBioscience or BD.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":38,"end":43},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":126,"end":129},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":230,"end":235},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":523,"end":527},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":580,"end":583},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":585,"end":588},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":585,"end":588},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":585,"end":588},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":585,"end":588},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":590,"end":594},"obj":"P10747"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
