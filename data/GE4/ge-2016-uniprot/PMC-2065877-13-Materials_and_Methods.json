Sections were antigen retrieved by microwaving in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min (LMP1 staining) and 10 min (pStat3 staining). For LMP1 staining, sections were blocked with 1% BSA and 0.1% cold fish skin gelatin followed with streptavidin/biotin block (Vector Labs). Rat IgG anti-LMP1 (clones 8G3 and 1G6, Ascenion) were used at 1:10 dilution from tissue culture supernatants, followed with 8 \u03bcg/ml biotinylated mouse F(ab') anti-rat IgG (H+L) pre-adsorbed to mouse serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 2 \u03bcg/ml streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Stains were developed with BCIP/NBT and counterstained in Nuclear Fast Red (Dako). Phospho-Stat3 was detected with 4 \u03bcg/ml of pStat3 antibody (Tyr705, Cell Signaling) and detected with anti-rabbit Poly-HRP IHC detection kit (Chemicon).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":213,"end":215},"obj":"P0A7Z4"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":233,"end":237},"obj":"P03230"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":260,"end":266},"obj":"P40763"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":282,"end":286},"obj":"P03230"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":431,"end":435},"obj":"P03230"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":821,"end":826},"obj":"P40763"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":856,"end":862},"obj":"P40763"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
