Whole cell lysates were prepared in NP-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl) in the presence of complete protease cocktail inhibitor. Lysates were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge to remove cellular debris. Samples were then immunoprecipitated with either 10 \u00b5l of antibody against GATA-3 or importin-\u03b1 using A/G agarose slurry in the presence of protease inhibitor using the Catch and Release methodology (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, New York, USA). Western blot analysis was performed using anti-GATA-3, anti-importin-\u03b1, anti-GR, anti-p-p38 MAP kinase, anti-p-ATF-2, and anti-p-serine. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":236,"end":238},"obj":"P0A7Z4"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":506,"end":512},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":730,"end":736},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":760,"end":762},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":771,"end":774},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":771,"end":774},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":771,"end":774},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":771,"end":774},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":794,"end":799},"obj":"P15336"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
