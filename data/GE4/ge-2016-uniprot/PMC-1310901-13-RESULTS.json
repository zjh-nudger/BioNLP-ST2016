A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, methylation of the IRF-4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells by 85.0% (Figure 5B). The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF-4-positive cells, since in vitro methylation led to a 92.9% abrogation of promoter activity in IRF-4-negative Jurkat cells (Figure 5C). In contrast, control methylation of a reporter construct with a different promoter (FasL) as well as an empty vector had no effect on the reporter activity (data not shown). These data proved a direct association between methylation and activity of the IRF-4 promoter.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":27,"end":32},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":151,"end":156},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":214,"end":219},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":450,"end":455},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":510,"end":515},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":620,"end":625},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":719,"end":724},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":844,"end":848},"obj":"P48023"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1018},"obj":"Q15306"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
