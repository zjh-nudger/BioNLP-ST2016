To confirm the role of PKC and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected the NF-\u03baB-SEAP construct with either WT NF-\u03baB p65 or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A constructs in Raw 264.7 cells, then treated cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presences of M-CSF. As expected in cells transfected with vector control, inhibiting PKC reduced M-CSF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle DMSO (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) (Figure 8A). In contrast, expressing WT NF-\u03baB p65 (p65 WT) increased NF-\u03baB activity, while the general PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 decreased this NF-\u03baB activity (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Notably, the introduction of NF-\u03baB p65 276 S/A construct significantly reduced NF-\u03baB activity compared with the WT NF-\u03baB p65 construct (p\u200a=\u200a0.005) and M-CSF treatment was unable to overcome this inhibition.\nFurthermore, we co-transfected the NF-\u03baB-SEAP construct along with either the WT NF-\u03baB p65, NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A or NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A constructs into a NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 murine fibroblast cell line and measured NF-\u03baB activity. As predicted, expression of WT NF-\u03baB p65 (p65 WT) in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line constitutively activated NF-\u03baB compared to cells transfected with vector control without any stimulation (Figure 8B). In comparison, transfecting the NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A construct reduced NF-\u03baB activity by 5-fold (p\u200a=\u200a0.006, WT NF-\u03baB p65 vs. NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A), while expressing the NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A construct increased NF-\u03baB activity in the p65\u2212/\u2212 cells to levels similar to WT NF-\u03baB p65 transfected cells.\nSince M-CSF-induced PKC activation regulated NF-\u03baB activity via Ser276 residue of NF-\u03baB p65 in primary human MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells, we next examined if this occurred in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts in response to a native stimulus for these cells, TNF\u03b1. NF-\u03baB activity was measured in the WT NF-\u03baB p65 or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A transfected cells treated with TNF\u03b1 in the absence or presence of Ro-31-8220 (Figure 8C). As expected, TNF\u03b1 increased NF-\u03baB activity in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing WT p65 and (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) PKC inhibitors decreased NF-\u03baB activity to the non-stimulated (NS) level (p\u200a=\u200a0.007). Introducing NF-\u03baB p65 276 S/A constructs significantly reduced NF-\u03baB activity compared with the WT NF-\u03baB p65 construct (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Notably, TNF\u03b1 failed to increase NF-\u03baB activity in the NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A constructs. These observations are similar to macrophages overexpressing the NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A (Figure 8A). Our data demonstrate that Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65 is essential in regulating NF-\u03baB activity and suggests that PKC regulates NF-\u03baB activity by modulating the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 at Ser276 residue.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":51},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":48,"end":51},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":93,"end":96},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":93,"end":96},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":170,"end":173},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":170,"end":173},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":293,"end":296},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":293,"end":296},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":419,"end":424},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":421,"end":424},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":503,"end":508},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":566,"end":571},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":656,"end":659},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":656,"end":659},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":811,"end":814},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":811,"end":814},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":897,"end":900},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":897,"end":900},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":927,"end":932},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":929,"end":932},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1073},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1073},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1081,"end":1084},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1081,"end":1084},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1101,"end":1104},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1101,"end":1104},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1139},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1139},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1240},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1240},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1242,"end":1245},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1242,"end":1245},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1262},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1262},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1432,"end":1435},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1432,"end":1435},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1507,"end":1510},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1507,"end":1510},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1524},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1524},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1561,"end":1564},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1561,"end":1564},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1614,"end":1617},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1614,"end":1617},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":1657,"end":1660},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":1657,"end":1660},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":1686,"end":1691},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":1688,"end":1691},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":1768,"end":1771},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":1768,"end":1771},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":1858,"end":1861},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":1858,"end":1861},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":1977,"end":1980},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":1977,"end":1980},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":1990,"end":1993},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":1990,"end":1993},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":2143,"end":2146},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":2143,"end":2146},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":2170,"end":2173},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":2170,"end":2173},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":2294,"end":2297},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":2294,"end":2297},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":2381,"end":2384},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":2381,"end":2384},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":2469,"end":2472},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":2469,"end":2472},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":2499,"end":2502},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":2499,"end":2502},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":2593,"end":2596},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin":2593,"end":2596},"obj":
