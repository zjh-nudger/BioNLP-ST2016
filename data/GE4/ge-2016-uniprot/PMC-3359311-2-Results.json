Cells were stimulated in accordance with the schedule in Figure 1. In CF, airway epithelial cells have been shown to possess a hyper-inflammatory phenotype and produce an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response [4], [5]. To determine if airway epithelial cells contribute to the increased IL-1\u03b2 production in patients with CF, CF and control bronchial epithelial cell lines were stimulated with the inflammasome inducers P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 (PAO1) and LPS followed by ATP. IL-1\u03b2 levels in cell culture supernatants were not greatly increased in either the CF or control cell lines (Fig. 2a\u2013d), although a small increase in IL-1\u03b2 production was detected in NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cells, but not in S9 and IB3-1 cells, by 24 hours. In contrast, these airway cells were highly responsive to other inflammatory stimuli, such as recombinant IL-1\u03b2, producing large quantities of IL-8 (Fig. 2a\u2013d inserts).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":62,"end":67},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":500,"end":505},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":690,"end":695},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":840,"end":845},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1053},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1089},"obj":"P10145"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
