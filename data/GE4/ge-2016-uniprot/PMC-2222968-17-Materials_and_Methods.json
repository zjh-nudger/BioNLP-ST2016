Proteins were expressed in BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) and lysates were purified by Ni2+-chelate column chromatography. Both TAT-linked proteins were more than 95% pure, based on Coomassie blue staining of sodium disulfate acrylamide gels.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":15},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":12,"end":15},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":12,"end":15},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":12,"end":15},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":45,"end":50},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":76,"end":81},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"obj":"P04605"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
