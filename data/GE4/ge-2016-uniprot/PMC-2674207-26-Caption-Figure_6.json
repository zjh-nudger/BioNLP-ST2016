Each bar represents the mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments; *** p<0.001 compared with control as determined by ANOVA/Newman-Keuls analysis. (C and D) Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of PBMCs from steroid-na\u00efve asthma patients treated with inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g via a spacer) in vivo demonstrated decreased association between GATA-3 and importin-\u03b1. The individual values for each treatment are presented graphically. (E) Representative Western blot showing that importin-\u03b1 expression was unaffected by inhalation of FP. Blot is representative of gels from three participants.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":37},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":76},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":272,"end":278},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":653,"end":659},"obj":"P23771"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
