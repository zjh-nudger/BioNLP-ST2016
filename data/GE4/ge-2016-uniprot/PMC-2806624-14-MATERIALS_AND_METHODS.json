After a 24-h culture in serum-free conditions and stimuli as indicated in the figures, luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PMA/ionomycin was used to stimulate the cells, because the transfection was only transient and the luciferase assay required a strong and fast stimulation of the cells. To evaluate the effect of overexpression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 on FOXP3 protein levels, CD4+ T cells were preactivated with 2 \u00b5g/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free AIM-V medium in the presence of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche) for 12 h, and then transfected with the vector pEGFPN1 containing the RUNX1 or RUNX3 fragment using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems) and the program T-23. FOXP3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry after 48 h of culture in AIM-V medium containing 1 nmol/liter IL-2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":74,"end":77},"obj":"P26358"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":112,"end":117},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":127,"end":137},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":189,"end":194},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":196,"end":201},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":259,"end":262},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":457,"end":467},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":502,"end":512},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":681,"end":691},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":795,"end":800},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":804,"end":809},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":813,"end":818},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":835,"end":838},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":928,"end":931},"obj":"P26358"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":973,"end":977},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1056,"end":1061},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1070},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1156},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1225,"end":1228},"obj":"P26358"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1266},"obj":"P60568"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
