This technique is especially useful for detection of unknown methylation patterns. PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the bisulfite-treated DNA showed a specific methylation pattern of the analyzed 62 CpG sites in all cell lines (Figure 4 and Table 1). In general, the methylational status ranged from one cell line with a nearly non-methylated IRF-4 promoter (SD-1, IRF-4-positive) to a completely methylated IRF-4 promoter in CML-T1 (IRF-4-negative). Interestingly, the percentage of CpG methylation in the IRF-4 promoter from IRF-4-positive cells was very low (mean 24%) as compared with IRF-4-negative cells (mean 94%) (Figure 4A and Table 1). A 5\u2032-region (R1) with 13 hypermethylated CpG sites (mean number of methylated clones 5.5 of 8 with 77% methylated CpGs) was found in most cells (except SD-1 and RPMI-8226) and a 3\u2032-region (R3) of 6 hypomethylated CpG sites (mean number of methylated clones 1.7 of 8 with 33% methylated CpGs) was found in most cells (except CML-T1 and U-937) (Figure 4A and Table 1).\nIntriguingly, a stretch of 13 CpG sites (#10\u201322; R2) was detected in between these regions, which were highly methylated in IRF-4-negative (mean number of methylated clones 7.1 of 8 with 89% methylated CpGs) but totally non-methylated in IRF-4-positive cells (Figure 4A and B). Furthermore, three CpG sites at the 5\u2032 end (#54, 56, 58) and two CpG motifs at the 3\u2032 end (#1, 2) showed this direct correlation between high methylation status and absence of IRF-4 expression. In addition, two CpG sites located in a NF\u03baB (#48) and a SP1 element (#45) are less methylated in IRF-4-positive than in IRF-4-negative cells (mean number of methylated clones: 1/8 versus 8/8). These results indicate the involvement of CpG methylation in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemic cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":26,"end":31},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":136,"end":141},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":766,"end":771},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":788,"end":793},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":831,"end":836},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":857,"end":862},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":930,"end":935},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":950,"end":955},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1017},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":1560,"end":1565},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1674,"end":1679},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1890,"end":1895},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1965,"end":1968},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":2006,"end":2011},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":2029,"end":2034},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":2181,"end":2186},"obj":"Q15306"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
