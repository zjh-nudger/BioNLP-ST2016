For this, CD4+ T\u00a0cells were differentiated for 2 consecutive weeks with high antigen doses in the presence or absence of IL-12 throughout (Figures 4A\u20134D). High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D). However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure\u00a04E). Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.\nTo determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ T\u00a0cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure\u00a04F). Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure\u00a04F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10. Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-\u03b3 but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (Figure\u00a0S4). Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":63,"end":68},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":63,"end":68},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":158,"end":163},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":158,"end":163},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":172,"end":177},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":208,"end":213},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":349,"end":354},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":349,"end":354},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":405,"end":410},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":405,"end":410},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":440,"end":445},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":541,"end":546},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":643,"end":648},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":643,"end":648},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":679,"end":684},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":772,"end":777},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":772,"end":777},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":782,"end":787},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":828,"end":833},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":946,"end":951},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":946,"end":951},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1044},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1115},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1158},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1219,"end":1224},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1219,"end":1224},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1369},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1369},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1430,"end":1435},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1480},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1480},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1511,"end":1516},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1551,"end":1554},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1624},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1624},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1703,"end":1708},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1703,"end":1708},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1748,"end":1753},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1775},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1829,"end":1834},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1829,"end":1834},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1901,"end":1906},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1918,"end":1923},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1962,"end":1967},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":2000,"end":2005},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":2000,"end":2005},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2084,"end":2089},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":2084,"end":2089},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2135,"end":2140},"obj":"P22301"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
