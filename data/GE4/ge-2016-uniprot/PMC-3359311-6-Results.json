We found that stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with heat-killed PAO1 produced the highest levels of NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activation (Fig. 6a) and this correlated with IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) but negligible amounts of IL-1\u03b2 were secreted (Fig. 6c). Stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with live PAO1 did not significantly increase NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity (Fig. 6a) or IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) over priming alone. However, IL-1\u03b2 production was greatly augmented over primed cells stimulated with heat-killed PAO1 or unprimed cells stimulated with live PAO1 (Fig. 6c). This confirmed that NF-\u03baB activation alone is not sufficient for maximal IL-1\u03b2 secretion, but increased priming of NF-\u03baB is capable of augmenting IL-1\u03b2 production and secretion upon inflammasome stimulation. Dependency of these responses on NF-\u03baB was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition of NF-\u03baB using the Bay11-7082 inhibitor of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, which significantly reduced NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activation (P<0.001) (Fig. 6d) and the subsequent production of IL-8 (P<0.01) (Fig. 6e) and IL-1\u03b2 (P<0.001) (Fig. 6f) in response to both heat-killed and live PAO1. These results were also verified in CF and control PBMCs for each inflammasome examined (P<0.001) (Fig. 6g\u2013h). Overall these results confirm that NF-\u03baB is an important modulator of IL-1\u03b2 production and that increased activation of NF-\u03baB augments inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1\u03b2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":43,"end":47},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":119,"end":124},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":225,"end":229},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":365,"end":369},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":416,"end":420},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":467,"end":472},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":593,"end":597},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":620,"end":624},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":674,"end":679},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":892,"end":897},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":965,"end":970},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1155},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1211},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1276,"end":1280},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1309},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1558,"end":1563},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1664},"obj":"P01584"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
