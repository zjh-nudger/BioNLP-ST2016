Both TNF and PMA+I triggered RPS3 nuclear translocation in Jurkat cells transfected with a scrambled nonspecific (NS) siRNA (Fig. 2a)6. RPS3 nuclear translocation was only slightly, if at all, impaired by IKK\u03b1-silencing. Conversely, knockdown of IKK\u03b2 attenuated 60-70% of RPS3 nuclear accumulation following stimulation (Fig. 2a). Immunoblotting of nuclear fractions confirmed that full expression of IKK\u03b2, but not IKK\u03b1, was necessary for activation-induced RPS3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 2b). Control immunoblots revealed that p65 nuclear translocation was blocked under the same conditions (Fig. 2b).\nWe next examined the nuclear translocation of RPS3 in cells ectopically expressing either kinase-dead (SSAA) or constitutively-active (SSEE) mutant IKK\u03b2 proteins. As expected, the SSEE, but not SSAA, mutant of IKK\u03b2 induced NF-\u03baB-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2c, left). Whereas RPS3 remained cytosolic in IKK\u03b2 (SSAA)-expressing cells (Fig. 2c, right), a substantial proportion of RPS3 translocated to the nucleus in cells expressing IKK\u03b2 (SSEE) (Fig. 2c, right). The percentage of cells containing detectable nuclear RPS3 increased 5-fold in IKK\u03b2 (SSEE)-expressing cells, but not in IKK\u03b2 (SSAA)-expressing ones (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, IKK\u03b2 activity is necessary and sufficient for RPS3 nuclear translocation in response to NF-\u03baB activating stimuli.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":25},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":71,"end":75},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":76,"end":80},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":109,"end":113},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":161,"end":165},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":250,"end":254},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":302,"end":305},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":326,"end":330},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":543,"end":547},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":569,"end":573},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":698,"end":702},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":755,"end":759},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":827,"end":830},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":827,"end":830},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":948,"end":952},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1050,"end":1054},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1116},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1141,"end":1151},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1195,"end":1199},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1222,"end":1226},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1297,"end":1301},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1350,"end":1354},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1434,"end":1438},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1500,"end":1504},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1570,"end":1574},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1616,"end":1620},"obj":"P23396"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
