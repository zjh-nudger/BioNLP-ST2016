Wu (NCI, Bethesda) and U. Siebenlist (NIAID, Bethesda), respectively. The HA-I\u03baB\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 (K44A)-Flag plasmids were purchased from Addgene44, 45. The Flag-RPS3, GST-RPS3, HA-RPS3, VN-HA, NleH1-HA plasmids were described previously6, 9. The point mutants of RPS3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Kit (Stratagene) with primers forward 5\u2032-CTGCCTGACCACGTGGCCATTGTGGAACCCAAA-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-TTTGGGTTCCACAATGGCCACGTGGTCAGGCAG-3\u2032 for S209A. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":32},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":46,"end":50},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":66,"end":70},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":190},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":195,"end":199},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":265,"end":269},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":275,"end":279},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":284,"end":288},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":297,"end":302},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":367,"end":371},"obj":"P23396"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
