In addition, because of the number of conventional PKCs existing within mononuclear cells, pharmacological inhibitors of PKC family activation was used to determine the relationship of PKC activation to M-CSF-induced cellular survival. MDMs were transfected with the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter and then treated with the general PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220; the conventional PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor G\u00f6-6976; or the intracellular calcium blocker BAPTA/AM. Ro-31-8220 significantly suppressed M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 2A). In addition, G\u00f6-6976 and BAPTA/AM also blocked NF-\u03baB activity in M-CSF-treated MDMs. Trypan blue exclusion analysis did not indicate cell death suggesting that this suppression was not due to non-specific toxicity. These data indicate that M-CSF mediated NF-\u03baB activation through calcium-dependent conventional PKC activation.\nWe next investigated whether PKC inhibition affected NF-\u03baB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Similar to MDMs, PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976 and BAPTA/AM reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Figure 2B). To ensure that PKC specifically regulated NF-\u03baB p65 and not the closely related family member, c-Rel, we co-transfected c-Rel and NF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs into the Raw 264.7 cell line and measured NF-\u03baB activity in response to M-CSF. There was no increased NF-\u03baB activity in cells expressing c-Rel (Figure S1). These observations indicate that PKC functioned upstream of NF-\u03baB p65 in MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":154,"end":159},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":518,"end":523},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":520,"end":523},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":681,"end":685},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":790,"end":795},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":792,"end":795},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":850,"end":855},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":852,"end":855},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":940,"end":945},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":942,"end":945},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1120},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1120},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1389,"end":1394},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1391,"end":1394},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1531,"end":1534},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1531,"end":1534},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1578,"end":1583},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1580,"end":1583},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1603,"end":1608},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1605,"end":1608},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1707,"end":1712},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1709,"end":1712},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1777},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1774,"end":1777},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1857,"end":1860},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1857,"end":1860},"obj":"P21579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
