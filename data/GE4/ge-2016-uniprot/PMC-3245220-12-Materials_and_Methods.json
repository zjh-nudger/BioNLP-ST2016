Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976, Rotterin, and BAPTA/AM were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Low endotoxin RPMI and X-vivo serum free medium were obtained from Lonza Walkersville Inc (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum (FBS, certified <0.06 endotoxin units/ml endotoxin levels) was purchased from Atlanta Biological (Lawrenceville, GA). All other cell culture reagents were obtained through Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). PKC\u03b1 NF-\u03baB p65, Lamin B, \u03b2-actin, and GAPDH antibodies, anti-mouse and rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated antibodies, and PKC\u03b1 siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
