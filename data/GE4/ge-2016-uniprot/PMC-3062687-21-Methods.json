Briefly, cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and then Cellspin mounted onto slides. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.05 % Triton X-100 in PBS and stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-RPS3 antibodies (Primm Biotech), or AlexaFluor 594-conjugated rat anti-Flag antibodies (BD) for 40 min together with 1 \u03bcg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 5 min at 25 \u00b0C. The slides were then rinsed with PBS three times and cover mounted for fluorescence microscopy.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":305,"end":309},"obj":"P23396"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
