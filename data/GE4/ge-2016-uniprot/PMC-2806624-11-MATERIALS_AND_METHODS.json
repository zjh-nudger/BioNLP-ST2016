Ethical permission was obtained from Cantonal Ethics Commission, and informed consent was obtained from patients. Paraformaldehyde-fixed tonsil cryosections were stained with unconjugated rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody to human RUNX1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or unconjugated mouse IgG1 mAb to human RUNX3 (Abcam). After a washing step, the sections were stained with the corresponding secondary antibodies. RUNX1-binding antibodies were detected by using Alexa Fluor 633\u2013conjugated goat anti\u2013rabbit IgG and RUNX3-binding antibodies were detected by using Alexa Fluor 532\u2013conjugated goat anti\u2013mouse IgG1. Afterward, the sections were washed and in the case of RUNX3 staining a blocking step with an unconjugated mouse IgG1 mAb was used. Finally, the sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated mouse IgG1 mAb to human FOXP3 (eBioscience) or the corresponding isotype control. Tissue sections were stained with DAPI for the demonstration of nuclei and mounted with Prolong antifade (Invitrogen). Images were acquired and analyzed using the confocal microscope DMI 4000B and the TCS SPE system (both from Leica).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":374,"end":379},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":453,"end":458},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":561,"end":566},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":661,"end":666},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":813,"end":818},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":981,"end":986},"obj":"Q9BZS1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
