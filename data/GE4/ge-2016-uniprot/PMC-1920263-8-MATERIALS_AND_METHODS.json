A nonspecific siRNA (Qiagen) was used as control. HeLa cells were transfected with 150 or 300\u2009ng siRNA per 6-well, using the HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for reverse transfection of adherent cells in 6-well plates.\nForty-eight hours after transfection, HeLa cells were harvested for detection of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. Cells were washed in PBS, lysed in RIPA (25\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 137\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Glycerol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 2\u2009mM EDTA pH 8, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors) and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. After boiling with Laemmli\u2032s buffer, samples were subjected to SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were detected using \u03b1-Sp1(Pep2) antibody (sc-59, Santa Cruz) or \u03b1-Sp3(D-20) antibody (sc-644, Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with \u03b1-rabbit-HRP (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of tubulin, \u03b1-tubulin (B5-1-2, Sigma) and \u03b1-mouse-HRP (Amersham Biosciences) antibodies were used. Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":43,"end":46},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":51,"end":54},"obj":"Q02447"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":122,"end":125},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":138,"end":141},"obj":"Q02447"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":513,"end":516},"obj":"Q02447"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":579,"end":581},"obj":"P0A7Z4"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":659,"end":661},"obj":"P0A7Z4"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":896,"end":899},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":904,"end":907},"obj":"Q02447"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":939,"end":942},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":983,"end":986},"obj":"Q02447"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
