In MDMs pretreated with PKC inhibitors (Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976, or BAPTA/AM) and stimulated with M-CSF, cleaved caspase-3 was elevated to levels of cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 3A). In contrast, cells incubated with M-CSF and vehicle had less cleaved caspase-3 than cells incubated with vehicle alone or M-CSF with PKC inhibitors. These data supported the hypothesis that M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity was regulated by conventional PKCs, not novel PKCs.\nTo confirm that PKC inhibition decreased cell survival, cells were treated with M-CSF in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitors and then also examined for apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining. PKC inhibitors in the presence of M-CSF reduced the number of Annexin V/PI negative MDMs compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 3B). These observations further suggested that MDM survival is promoted by M-CSF and critically involves conventional PKCs and NF-\u03baB activity.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":61,"end":64},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":160,"end":165},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":162,"end":165},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":263,"end":272},"obj":"P42574"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":340,"end":345},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":342,"end":345},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":460,"end":465},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":462,"end":465},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":475,"end":484},"obj":"P42574"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":591,"end":596},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":593,"end":596},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":626,"end":635},"obj":"P42574"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":679,"end":684},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":681,"end":684},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":747,"end":752},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":749,"end":752},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":908,"end":913},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":910,"end":913},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":999,"end":1008},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1056,"end":1061},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1058,"end":1061},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1093},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1147},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1144,"end":1147},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1242},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1239,"end":1242},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
