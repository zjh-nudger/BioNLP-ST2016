To detect expression of surface molecules, cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in FACS wash buffer (3% FBS, 0.1% sodium azide, 30 mM Hepes, 1\u00d7 PBS) containing the antibodies indicated in the figures at previously optimized concentrations, incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT), washed, and resuspended in 2% formaldehyde fixative solution before acquisition on a FACSCalibur (BD).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
