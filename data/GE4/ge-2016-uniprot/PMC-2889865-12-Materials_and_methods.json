Briefly, Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with PMA (162 nM) for 1 h, centrifuged (1000 \u00d7 g, 8 min) and the supernatants were collected and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Following centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1 h aged media, where cells have been grown in, containing PMA. The same procedure was performed to collect media after 2 h and 6 h. The final collection of media was performed after 24 h.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":121,"end":125},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":127,"end":132},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":137,"end":140},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":158,"end":162},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":190,"end":195},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":226,"end":229},"obj":"P01375"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
