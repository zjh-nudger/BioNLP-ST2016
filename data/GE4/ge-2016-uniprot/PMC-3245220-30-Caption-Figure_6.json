Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. Real-time RT PCR was performed using primers for I\u03baB\u03b1, BCL-xl or GAPDH. Data are expressed as relative fold increase of I\u03baB\u03b1 or BCL-xl gene expression upon treatment over non-stimulated cells. Data represent the mean \u00b1 S.E.M for three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":16,"end":19},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":215,"end":220},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":217,"end":220},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":353,"end":357},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":369,"end":374},"obj":"P04406"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":398,"end":406},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":424,"end":428},"obj":"P25963"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
