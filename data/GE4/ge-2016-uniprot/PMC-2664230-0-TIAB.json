The mechanism by which phosphodiesterase inhibition alters TNF-\u03b1 production in the presence of LPS remains unclear.\nMETHODS\nHuman mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL), in the presence and absence of Pentoxifylline (PTX; 20 mM), a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Western blotting of phosphorylated cytoplasmic I-\u03baB\u03b1, nuclear factor-\u03baB p65 (NF-\u03baB), and nuclear cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) was performed. DNA binding of NF-\u03baB and CREB was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TNF-\u03b1 levels were determined in the supernatant of stimulated cells in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nRESULTS\nPTX was demonstrated to significantly reduce cytoplasmic I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, nuclear p65 phosphorylation, and the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. In contrast, PTX markedly enhanced the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of CREB. Cells concomitantly treated with PTX and LPS secreted similar levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition.\nDISCUSSION\nThe increased level of cAMP that results from phosphodiesterase inhibition affects cytoplasmic and nuclear events, resulting in the attenuation of NF-\u03baB and the activation of CREB transcriptional DNA binding through pathways that are partially Protein kinase A-independent.\nCONCLUSION\nPTX-mediated phosphodiesterase inhibition occurs partially through a Protein kinase A-independent pathway and may serve as a useful tool in the attenuation of LPS-induced inflammation.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":35},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":32,"end":37},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":283,"end":304},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":312,"end":315},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":312,"end":317},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":425,"end":428},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":425,"end":430},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":578,"end":581},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":578,"end":583},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":878,"end":881},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":878,"end":881},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":903,"end":940},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":903,"end":940},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":903,"end":940},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":903,"end":940},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":903,"end":940},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":903,"end":940},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":942,"end":946},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":942,"end":946},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":942,"end":946},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":942,"end":946},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":942,"end":946},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":942,"end":946},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":988,"end":992},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":988,"end":992},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":988,"end":992},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":988,"end":992},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":988,"end":992},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":988,"end":992},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1050},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1052},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1319},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1319},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1537,"end":1540},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1537,"end":1542},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1786,"end":1790},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1786,"end":1790},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1786,"end":1790},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1786,"end":1790},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1786,"end":1790},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1786,"end":1790},"obj":"O43889"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
