Interestingly, adding M-CSF did not alter NF-\u03baB DNA binding by EMSA. In contrast, after transiently transfecting human MDMs with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs containing four NF-\u03baB consensus binding sequences, M-CSF treatment of the transfected cells resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in SEAP release in the culture media compared to PBS (vehicle)-treated transfected MDMs (Figure 1B). As a control, the pTAL-SEAP construct lacking NF-\u03baB binding sites was used. Cells transfected with the pTAL-SEAP construct did not produce SEAP in the absence or presence of M-CSF (Figure 1B).\nWe next investigated whether M-CSF induced NF-\u03baB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with either the NF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter or control pTAL-SEAP construct. As shown in Figure 1C, M-CSF treatment of RAW 264.7 cells increased NF-\u03baB reporter activity by 2.5-fold over that of non-treated cells. Together, our data demonstrate that M-CSF induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in macrophages.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":2,"end":5},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":148,"end":153},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":150,"end":153},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":253,"end":258},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":255,"end":258},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":411,"end":414},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":590,"end":595},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":592,"end":595},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":938,"end":943},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":940,"end":943},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":986,"end":991},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":988,"end":991},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1190},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1187,"end":1190},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1339},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1336,"end":1339},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
