Transduction of both HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) clones with a retrovirus encoding FLAG-HOIP reversed defective CD80 upregulation, while transduction with an empty vector (pMIP) did not. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":48,"end":52},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":150,"end":154},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":257,"end":261},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":355,"end":359},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":371,"end":375},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":419,"end":423},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":443,"end":447},"obj":"P33681"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
