Unstained cells serve as negative controls. (B) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (1\u00d7105 cells in 0.1 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with medium, 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 \u00b5g/ml poly I:C for 24 hours. Supernatants were collected for ELISA of IL10. (C) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (5\u00d7105 cells in 0.2 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 \u00b5g/ml poly I:C. At 0, 1, and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the production of A20.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":7,"end":11},"obj":"O00206"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":49},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":64,"end":67},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":169,"end":173},"obj":"O00206"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":186,"end":190},"obj":"P08571"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":480,"end":484},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":722,"end":725},"obj":"P21580"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
