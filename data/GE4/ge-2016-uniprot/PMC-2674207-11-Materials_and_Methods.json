GATA-3 was excised from pOTB7 using XhoI digestion and pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was digested with BamHI. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the GATA-3 fragment and the pEGFP-C2 vector blunt-ended by incubation with Klenow (Bioline Bio-27029) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Klenow was inactivated by incubation for 10 min at 75\u00b0C. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the blunt-ended GATA-3 fragment and the GFP vector were subsequently digested with EcoRI before the 5\u2032-EcoRI/3\u2032\u2013blunt end GATA-3 fragment was inserted into the 5\u2032-EcoRI/3\u2032\u2013blunt ended GFP vector. Positive clones were confirmed by digestion and size analysis by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and by sequencing.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":7,"end":10},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":25,"end":31},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":143,"end":149},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":171,"end":177},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":381,"end":387},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":647,"end":653},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":671,"end":674},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":753,"end":759},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":815,"end":818},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
