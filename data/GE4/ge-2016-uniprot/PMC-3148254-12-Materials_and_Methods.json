Briefly, 1\u00d7106 cells were stimulated overnight with anti-CD40 antibody (10 \u00b5g/ml) or an isotype control antibody, with or without 500 U/ml mouse IL-4 (BD Biosciences). RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and reverse-transcribed (Superscript III kit, Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR for GL\u03b5 and Hprt1 was performed using SYBR GREEN master mix (Applied Biosystems), and an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR instrument. Expression of GL\u03b5 in each sample was normalized to the expression of Hprt1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":25,"end":29},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":54,"end":57},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":260,"end":264},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":407,"end":410},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":563,"end":566},"obj":"Q28322"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
