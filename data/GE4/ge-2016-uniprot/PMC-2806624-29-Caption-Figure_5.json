(A) FACS-purified naive CD4+ CD8\u2212 T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAb, 50 U/ml IL-2, \u00b1 10 nM retinoic acid (RA), and increasing concentrations of TGF-\u03b2. After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA + ionomycin, and then analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-\u03b3 expression. One of five experiments is shown. (B) Naive CD4+ T cells from Cbfb CD4-cre or control mice (harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele) were adoptively transferred into Rag-deficient mice (5 \u00d7 106 cells per transfer). 6 wk later, TCR\u03b2+CD4+ cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and lamina propria of the small intestine (LP) were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression. Results from one of four CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice with same findings are shown. The data from four sets of mice is shown in C. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test. *, P < 0.05 between groups.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":27},"obj":"Q13951"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":41},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":42,"end":45},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":80,"end":85},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":87,"end":90},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":125,"end":128},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":160,"end":163},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":184,"end":187},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":188,"end":191},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":251,"end":255},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":433,"end":438},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":443,"end":448},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":523,"end":527},"obj":"Q13951"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":532,"end":535},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":565,"end":570},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":576,"end":579},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":687,"end":690},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":809,"end":814},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":815,"end":818},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":864,"end":867},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":868,"end":871},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":892,"end":895},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":896,"end":899},"obj":"P06956"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
