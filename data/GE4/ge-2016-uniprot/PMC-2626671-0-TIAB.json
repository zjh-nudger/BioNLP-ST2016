CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes. We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) \u03b3 expression, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate a critical role for the transcription factor Runx3 in CTL differentiation. Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-\u03b3, perforin, and granzyme B. Our data point to the existence of an elaborate transcriptional network in which Runx3 initially induces and then cooperates with T-box transcription factors to regulate gene transcription in differentiating CTLs.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":113,"end":116},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":113,"end":116},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":327,"end":335},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":500,"end":505},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":542,"end":547},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":739,"end":744},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":769,"end":774},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":785,"end":790},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":879,"end":884},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":886,"end":894},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":900,"end":910},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":993,"end":998},"obj":"Q13761"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
