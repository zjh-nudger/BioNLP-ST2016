However, it is unknown how RPS3 nuclear translocation is regulated. Here we report that IKK\u03b2 phosphorylation of serine 209 (S209) was crucial for RPS3 nuclear localization in response to activating stimuli. Moreover, the foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 virulence protein NleH1 specifically inhibited RPS3 S209 phosphorylation and blocked RPS3 function, thereby promoting bacterial colonization and diarrhea but decreasing mortality in a gnotobiotic piglet infection model. Thus, the IKK\u03b2-dependent modification of a specific amino acid in RPS3 promotes specific NF-\u03baB functions that underlie the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of E. coli O157:H7.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":31,"end":35},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":195,"end":199},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":351,"end":355},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":409,"end":413},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":546,"end":551},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":575,"end":579},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":613,"end":617},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":758,"end":762},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":814,"end":818},"obj":"P23396"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
