These cytokines can be divided into three subgroups: TGF-\u03b2, the activins/inhibins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), of which the latter constitute the largest family. BMPs are 30\u201338 kDa hetero- or homodimeric proteins originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation [2,3]. Several studies have demonstrated an essential role of these proteins during embryogenesis, and more recently, also in adult tissues [1]. TGF-\u03b2 has been intensively studied in normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and is one of the most potent endogenous negative regulators known to date. [4]. In contrast, the effect of BMPs in the immune system has not been widely investigated. In that respect, BMP- 2, -4 and -7 have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [5] and early T cell development [6,7]. BMP-6 has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone-area-forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells [8]. Furthermore, BMP-2, -4, 6 and -7 had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells [9-11]. In addition, by gene expression profiling, BMP-6 significantly increased the predictive value for a multi-gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) [12].\nBMP-6, like the other BMP members, signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of BMP type I [activin-like-kinase (ALK)] and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating Smad proteins. BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIA, and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII, Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8). The R- Smads then form complexes with the co-Smad (Smad4) and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation [1,13].\nGiven the reported role of BMP-6 in B-cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells, we wanted to explore its potential role in normal human B cells. We studied the effects of BMP-6 on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated B cells. Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1\u2013Id4, were resolved. Finally, we investigated whether B cells also were capable of producing BMP-6.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":15,"end":43},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":50},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":221,"end":226},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":259,"end":286},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":259,"end":286},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":259,"end":286},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":259,"end":286},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":288,"end":292},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":288,"end":292},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":288,"end":292},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":288,"end":292},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":346,"end":350},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":346,"end":350},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":346,"end":350},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":346,"end":350},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":628,"end":633},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":893,"end":896},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":893,"end":896},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":893,"end":896},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":893,"end":896},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1025},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1025},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1025},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1025},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1027},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1161},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1307},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1307},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1307},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1307},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1309},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1477},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1477},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1477},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1477},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1474,"end":1479},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1499},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1499},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1499},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1499},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1562},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1562},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1562},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1562},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1734},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1734},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1734},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1734},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1736},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":1793,"end":1800},"obj":"Q04771"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":1802,"end":1805},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":1802,"end":1805},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":1802,"end":1805},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":1802,"end":1805},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":1802,"end":1809},"obj":"P36894"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1818},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1818},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1818},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1818},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1822},"obj":"O00238"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1852},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1852},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1852},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1852},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1856},"obj":"Q13873"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":1858,"end":1866},"obj":"P27037"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":1871,"end":1879},"obj":"Q13705"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin":1938,"end":1944},
