Arrows (F and R) indicate approximate positions of sequences homologous to oligonucleotides used for PCR-mediated detection of homologous recombination. Homologous recombination of the vector with Rnf31 resulted in a small chromosomal deletion and the in-frame insertion of neomycin phosphotransferase (NeoR) into the amino-terminal HOIP coding sequence. A diphtheria toxin (DT) cassette in the vector facilitates the negative selection of cells in which random chromosomal insertion of the vector takes place. LoxP sequences allow the Cre-mediated deletion of the NeoR coding sequence. The SV40pA sequence helps to ensure disruption of gene expression after deletion of the NeoR sequence. (B) Anti-HOIP and anti-FLAG Western blots of cell lysates from A20.2J cells and HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) clones. A partial decrease in HOIP protein expression is evident in cells following disruption of one copy of Rnf31 (HOIP\u2212/+). HOIP expression in clones reconstituted with an empty retroviral vector (pMIP) or a retroviral vector encoding FLAG-tagged HOIP is also shown. Approximate molecular weight of HOIP is 120 kD.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":36,"end":41},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":77,"end":81},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":454,"end":458},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":657,"end":660},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":820,"end":824},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":874,"end":877},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":891,"end":895},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":907,"end":911},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":946,"end":950},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1026,"end":1031},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1037},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1047},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1166,"end":1170},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1218,"end":1222},"obj":"Q96EP0"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
