Cells were harvested after 5 days and FOXP3 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of 4 independent experiments.\n(B) In vitro differentiated Th1, Th2, or iTreg cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28, TGF-\u03b2, or anti-IL-4 as indicated. The phenotype of these cells was confirmed by FACS and proliferation analysis (Figure S1). Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of four independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":24,"end":29},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":96,"end":99},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":96,"end":99},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":96,"end":99},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":96,"end":99},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":100,"end":104},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":121,"end":126},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":200,"end":205},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":376,"end":379},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":376,"end":379},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":376,"end":379},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":376,"end":379},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":380,"end":384},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":386,"end":391},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":401,"end":405},"obj":"P05112"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
