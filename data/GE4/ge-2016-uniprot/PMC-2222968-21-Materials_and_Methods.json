The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Amersham Life Science). Unspecific binding was blocked with BSA, and the membranes were subsequently incubated with an 1:200 dilution of goat anti-FOXP3 in blocking buffer (Abcam) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The blots were developed using an anti-goat HRP-labeled mAb (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with a LAS 1000 camera (Fuji). Membranes were incubated in stripping buffer and re-blocked for 1 h. The membranes were re-probed using anti-GATA3 (HG3\u201331; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-T-bet (4B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH (6C5, Ambion), anti-phospho-SMAD2 (138D4), anti-phospho-STAT6 (5A4), and anti-STAT6 (Cell Signaling Technology),","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":27},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":67,"end":70},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":71,"end":75},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":406,"end":411},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":696,"end":701},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":743,"end":748},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":788,"end":793},"obj":"P04406"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":822,"end":827},"obj":"Q15796"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":850,"end":855},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":872,"end":877},"obj":"P42226"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
