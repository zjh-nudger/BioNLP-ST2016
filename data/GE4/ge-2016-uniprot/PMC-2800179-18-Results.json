Both 10 kDa and 40 kDa dCGN induced a robust increase in mRNA for both ICAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 6). \u03b2-actin mRNA levels were not affected by dCGN treatment.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":41},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":46,"end":49},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":46,"end":51},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":92,"end":98},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":114,"end":117},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":114,"end":119},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":276,"end":282},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":287,"end":290},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":287,"end":292},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":303,"end":310},"obj":"P60709"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
