In generating the double knockout cell lines we targeted the PKD1 loci in a PKD3\u2212/\u2212 cell line that expressed a Flag-PKD3 transgene under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Hence, in the presence of doxycycline, Flag-PKD3 expression in PKD1/3 double knockout cells is comparable to endogenous PKD3 present in wild-type DT40 cells and removal of doxycycline from the culture media for 5 days results in a completely null PKD phenotype (Fig. 1A).\nPreviously, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) during BCR engagement is defective in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 B cells and can restored upon re-expression of a single PKD isoform [1]. The small heat shock protein HSP27 has recently been proposed as a PKD1 substrate [24] and we accordingly assessed whether PKD-null DT40 cells have defective phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, the proposed PKD1 substrate sequence. We initially investigated the regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation in single knockout DT40 B cells lacking either PKD1 or PKD3. As shown in Fig. 1B, activation of the BCR or treatment with the DAG-mimetic PdBu increased the levels of HSP27 phosphorylation at S82 in wild-type DT40 B cells. BCR and phorbol ester signals were also able to increase HSP27 phosphorylation in PKD1 or PKD3 single knockout DT40 B cells (Fig. 1B). However, BCR- and phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 on S82 was abolished in B cells that lacked both PKD1 and PKD3 (Fig. 1C). Significantly, doxycycline-induced expression of the Flag-PKD3 transgene in the double knockout cells was sufficient to restore normal regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, expression of a kinase-deficient PKD3 mutant protein in the double knockout cells was not able to restore BCR- or phorbol ester-induced HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Hence, PKD3 as well as PKD1 can regulate HSP27 phosphorylation and in DT40 B cells they are functionally redundant as HSP27 kinases.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":16},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":138,"end":142},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":248,"end":252},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":256,"end":260},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":343,"end":347},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":358,"end":362},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":398,"end":402},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":512,"end":516},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":531,"end":535},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":588,"end":592},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":864,"end":867},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":895,"end":899},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1012},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1049},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1160},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1192},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1262},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1330},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1338},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1379,"end":1382},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1446,"end":1451},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1502,"end":1505},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1542,"end":1546},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1564},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1584,"end":1588},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1592,"end":1596},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1646,"end":1649},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1696,"end":1701},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1751,"end":1755},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1764},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1834,"end":1838},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1925,"end":1930},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":2004,"end":2008},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":2061,"end":2065},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":2077,"end":2080},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":2107,"end":2112},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":2147,"end":2151},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":2163,"end":2167},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":2181,"end":2186},"obj":"P04792"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":2258,"end":2263},"obj":"P04792"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
