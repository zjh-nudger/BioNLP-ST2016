Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 10\u2009min. on ice after resuspension in SDS lysis buffer (ChIP Assay Kit, Upstate). After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in MNase reaction buffer (10\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10\u2009mM NaCl, 3\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM CaCl2, 4% NP-40). DNA digestion was performed using 50 U Micrococcal Nuclease (Fermentas) and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 cells per tube in a volume of 1.5\u2009ml. After 2\u2009min, reaction was stopped by adding 30\u2009\u00b5l 200\u2009mM EGTA. Further steps were performed using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 cells and 2\u2009\u00b5g antibody (Sp1(Pep2) sc-59, Sp3(D-20) sc-644 or actin(H-196) sc-7210, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for each immunoprecipitation. All buffers were freshly supplied with protease inhibitors. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, DNA was resolved in 16\u2009\u00b5l H2O. Immunoprecipitated DNA was detected by nested PCR using 4\u2009\u00b5l of the resolved DNA in the first PCR, and 1\u2009\u00b5l for the nested PCR. For amplification of the A3G promoter, the following primers were used: ChIP3Gplus 5\u2032-ccacggtggcctccgagggtga-3\u2032 and ChIP3Gminus: 5\u2032-ctctccaccatcaagacagac-3\u2032 (1. PCR); ChIP3G2plus: 5\u2032-tactctccctccctgtcccca-3\u2032 and ChIP3G nested minus: 5\u2032-aggctgatgcctccgcag-3\u2032 (nested PCR). Taq polymerase (Qiagen) was used together with the following cycle conditions: one cycle 94\u00b0C for 2\u2009min; 30 cycles 94\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 60\u00b0C for 60\u2009s, 72\u00b0C for 2\u2009min; one cycle 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. As a negative control, a region in the A3G gene was targeted using the primers ChIP3Gneg_plus: 5\u2032-taagtaccacccagagatgag-3\u2032 and ChIP3Gneg_minus: 5\u2032-catgatcttcatggtggcacg-3\u2032 for both PCR steps. PCR conditions were the same as for the A3G promoter sequence, with the exception that annealing temperature was decreased to 55\u00b0C.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":370,"end":372},"obj":"P0A7Z4"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":778,"end":781},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":795,"end":798},"obj":"Q02447"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":1209,"end":1212},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":1683,"end":1686},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":1876,"end":1879},"obj":"Q9HC16"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
