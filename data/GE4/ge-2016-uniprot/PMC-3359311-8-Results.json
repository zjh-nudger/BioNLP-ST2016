To determine whether CFTR dysfunction alters IL-1\u03b2 production, THP-1 cells and PBMCs from CF patients and healthy controls were treated with the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, prior to simulation with live P. aeruginosa. Treatment with CFTRinh172 did not alter IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 production in control subjects or CF patients (Fig. 8a\u2013b). Similarly, IL-1\u03b2 production was not different in monocyte-derived macrophages or THP-1 reporter cells treated with CFTRinh172 (Fig. 8c\u2013d). IL-8 (Fig. 8e) and NF-\u03baB activity (Fig. 8f) were also unchanged in CFTRinh172-treated THP-1 reporter cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":51},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":256,"end":261},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":469,"end":474},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":478,"end":482},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":553,"end":558},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":681,"end":685},"obj":"P10145"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
