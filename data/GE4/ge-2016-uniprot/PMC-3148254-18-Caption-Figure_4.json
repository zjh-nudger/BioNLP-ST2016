Cells were activated with CD154-expressing insect cells for the times indicated. As a negative control, cells were stimulated with insect cells lacking CD154 (5 minute time point only). Western blots of whole-cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies. Phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 (pI\u03baB\u03b1) and phospho-JNK (pJNK) blots were stripped and reprobed for total I\u03baB\u03b1 and total JNK, respectively (anti-JNK antibodies recognize p46 and p54 isoforms). I\u03baB\u03b1 blots were also reprobed for actin to demonstrate equal lane loading. Molecular weights are indicated at right. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment and in two additional experiments with a second HOIP-deficient clone.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":57,"end":61},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":79,"end":83},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":120,"end":124},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":142,"end":146},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":232,"end":235},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":254,"end":258},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":320,"end":324},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":326,"end":330},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":336,"end":340},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":369,"end":374},"obj":"P29965"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":495,"end":500},"obj":"P29965"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":616,"end":620},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":695,"end":699},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":767,"end":770},"obj":"Q13451"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":782,"end":786},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1004},"obj":"Q96EP0"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
