(B) Time course of the effect of FP (10\u22128 M) on phosphorylation of activated transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), a measure of p38 MAPK activity. (C) FP-induced inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is associated with the decrease of anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation\u2013induced serine phosphorylation (P-Ser) of GATA-3. For (A\u2013C), quantification of the densitometry data is also shown. Each bar represents mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to \u03b1CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) FP induced MKP-1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments and where appropriate expressed as means\u00b1SEM, *p<0.05. (E) FP induces MKP-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Results are representative of two independent experiments. All data except (E) were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":49},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":46,"end":49},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":46,"end":49},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":46,"end":49},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":139,"end":145},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":302,"end":305},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":302,"end":305},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":302,"end":305},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":302,"end":305},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":319,"end":322},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":319,"end":322},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":319,"end":322},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":319,"end":322},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":323,"end":327},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":423,"end":455},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":457,"end":462},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":478,"end":481},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":478,"end":481},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":478,"end":481},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":478,"end":481},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":526,"end":529},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":526,"end":529},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":526,"end":529},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":526,"end":529},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":584,"end":587},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":584,"end":587},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":584,"end":587},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":584,"end":587},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":588,"end":592},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":650,"end":656},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":856,"end":860},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":894,"end":899},"obj":"P28562"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1090},"obj":"P28562"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
