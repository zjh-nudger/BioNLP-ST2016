Ziegler (Benaroya Research Institute). pEGFP-C2 was provided by I. Lipinski (NIDDK/NIH). pcDNA3 was provided by K. T. Jeang (NIAID/NIH). pCMV4-Tax was a generous gift from W. Greene (University of California San Francisco). pGL4-luc2 and pGL4-TKhRluc2 were purchased from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin, United States). pUC18 was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States). HIV-1 wt LTR and HIV-1 \u0394-\u03baB LTR luciferase reporter vectors were constructed by cloning the XhoI/HindIII LTR fragments from pHIV-CAT and p\u0394-\u03baB-HIV-CAT (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID/NIH) into the multiple cloning site of pGL4-luc2. NF-\u03baB, HTLV-I LTR, and CREB luciferase reporter and pCMV-p300-HA expression vectors were generously provided by B. Wigdahl (Drexel University College of Medicine). HTLV-I pACH infectious molecular clone has been described previously [30]. pFR-luc, pFA-CMV, pFA2-CREB-1, and pFA2-c-Jun were purchased from Stratagene. pFA-Tax (encoding a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused in-frame to HTLV-I Tax) was constructed by PCR amplification of HTLV-I Tax using pCMV4-Tax as a template and BamHI/BglII-tagged primers. The amplified insert was digested and ligated into the BamHI/BglII sites of pFA-CMV. Plasmid contents were confirmed by DNA sequencing.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":49},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":56,"end":61},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":316,"end":319},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":597,"end":607},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":841,"end":845},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":841,"end":845},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":841,"end":845},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":841,"end":845},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":841,"end":845},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":841,"end":845},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":846,"end":856},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":875,"end":879},"obj":"Q09472"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1084},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1084},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1086},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1084},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1084},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1084},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1084},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1097,"end":1102},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1102},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1142},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1192},"obj":"P04386"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1240},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1292},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1305,"end":1308},"obj":"P03409"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
