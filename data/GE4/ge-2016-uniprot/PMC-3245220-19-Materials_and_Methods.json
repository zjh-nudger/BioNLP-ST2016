Briefly, human monocytes (5\u00d7106) were incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium and restimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF overnight. The cells were removed from the culture dish using Accutase (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and stained with Annexin V\u2013FITC and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD PharMingen). Annexin V-FITC and PI double negative cells were considered non-apoptotic cells for statistical analysis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":103,"end":112},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":302,"end":307},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":304,"end":307},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":425,"end":434},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":508,"end":517},"obj":"P08758"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
