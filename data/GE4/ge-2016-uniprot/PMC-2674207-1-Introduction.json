IL-4 and IL-13 regulate the expression of IgE from B lymphocytes, whereas IL-5 plays a key role in eosinophilic inflammation [1]. Th2 cytokines are regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-3, which is predominantly expressed in Th2 cells [2],[3]. GATA-3 determines Th2 cell differentiation and selectively activates the promoters of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 through chromatin remodelling [4]\u2013[7]. The key role of GATA-3 in allergic airway inflammation has been demonstrated in mice by the reduced release of Th2 cytokines in animals treated with dominant-negative mutants of GATA-3 and by local application of antisense oligonucleotides to GATA-3 [8],[9]. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of the Gata3 gene in mice reduces expression of Th2 cytokines in vitro and in vivo [10], and similar results have been reported in isolated murine CD4+ lymphocytes [11]. Finally, knockdown of GATA-3 expression using siRNA in human T cells results in loss of anti-CD3/CD28-mediated Th2 cytokine expression [12].\nIn order for GATA-3 to regulate gene expression, it must translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to access its target genes. Enhanced nuclear expression of GATA-3 following T cell receptor activation was first demonstrated in murine T cells [13] and was recently confirmed in human T cells following T cell receptor and co-receptor stimulation [12]. GATA-3 contains a classical nuclear import signal [14] and is transported into the nucleus by the nuclear import protein importin-\u03b1 (also known as karyopherin-\u03b1) [12]. Deletion of a region encompassing the GATA-3 nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) region in murine and human cells prevents its nuclear localisation [12],[14]. The affinity of the importin-\u03b1\u2013NLS interaction is regulated by phosphorylation [15], and we have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a critical role in phosphorylating GATA-3 to enhance its interaction with importin-\u03b1 and subsequent transport into the nucleus [12].\nCorticosteroids are highly effective in the treatment of allergic inflammation, with marked suppression of Th2 cytokines in airways of patients with asthma [16]. Corticosteroids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of steroid-sensitive genes. Alternatively, activated GR interacts with coactivator molecules to suppress the expression of inflammatory genes by inhibiting the action of proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) through the recruitment of co-repressor molecules such as histone deacetylase-2 [17],[18].\nNuclear localisation and retention of GR is mediated through the nuclear localisation sequences NL1 and NL2 [19], by nuclear retention signals [20], and by control of nuclear export via a chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM-1) dependent pathway [21]. NL1, which is similar to the SV40 NLS, binds to importin-\u03b1 [22]. NL1 is activated both by glucocorticoid agonists such as dexamethasone and fluticasone propionate (FP) and by glucocorticoid antagonists such as mifepristone (RU486) [23]. NL1 can be mutated, and the resulting GR still translocates to the nucleus in response to ligands, but via interaction with importin 7, an event that requires an as-yet unknown component [23]. NL2 is poorly defined, residing in the ligand-binding domain, and much less is known about its mechanism of GR import [24]. A variety of other factors are also important for the regulation of GR activation and nuclear import including chaperones such as Hsp90 and other immunophilins [24]\u2013[26] and FK506-binding proteins that may be linked to dynein and/or peptidylprolyl isomerase [27],[28].\nHowever, the molecular basis for the inhibition of Th2 cytokines by corticosteroids is not well understood, because the genes encoding IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 do not have any recognisable GRE sequence [29] and are only partly regulated by NF-\u03baB in human cells [30]\u2013[32]. Using overexpression and CAT-reporter genes, Lavender and colleagues [33] have shown that GR reduced GATA-3-mediated IL-5 and -13 promoter activity in human CD4+ T cells. The authors postulated that local recruitment of GR may alter the ability of GATA-3 either to bind to its target site, to cause transcriptional up-regulation, or to maintain an environment that is permissive for transcription.\nWe therefore investigated the effects of a synthetic corticosteroid, FP, on GATA-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in a T lymphocyte cell line (HuT-78) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro. We also studied the effects of inhaled fluticasone therapy on GATA-3 subcellular localization in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with asthma.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"P05113"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":156,"end":161},"obj":"P35225"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":191,"end":195},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":200,"end":205},"obj":"P35225"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":265,"end":269},"obj":"P05113"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":389,"end":395},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":452,"end":458},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":538,"end":542},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":544,"end":548},"obj":"P05113"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":554,"end":559},"obj":"P35225"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":615,"end":621},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":777,"end":783},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":842,"end":848},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":900,"end":905},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1043},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1091},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1159},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1164},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1223},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1374},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1568},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1768,"end":1774},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1997,"end":2000},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1997,"end":2000},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1997,"end":2000},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1997,"end":2000},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":2001,"end":2033},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":2001,"end":2033},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":2082,"end":2088},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":2417,"end":2441},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":2443,"end":2446},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":2629,"end":2631},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":2947,"end":2949},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":3437,"end":3439},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":3700,"end":3702},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":3784,"end":3786},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":4120,"end":4124},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":4126,"end":4130},"obj":"P05113"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":4136,"end":4141},"obj":"P35225"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":4344,"end":4346},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":4355,"end":4361},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":4371,"end":4375},"obj":"P05113"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":4411,"end":4414},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":4474,"end":4476},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":4502,"end":4508},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":4728,"end":4734},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":4874,"end":4877},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":4874,"end":4877},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":4874,"end":4877},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":4874,"end":4877},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":4887,"end":4891},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":4975,"end":4981},"obj":"P23771"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
