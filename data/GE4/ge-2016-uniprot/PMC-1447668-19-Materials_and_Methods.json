Cells (1.5 \u00d7 106) were fixed by sequential formaldehyde/methanol fixation as follows. Cells were carefully resuspended in FACS buffer and fixed with 100 \u03bcl of reagent A (Fix & Perm kit; Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States) at room temperature for 3 min followed by 2 ml of 70% methanol for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were washed twice and permeabilized with 100 \u03bcl of reagent B (Fix & Perm kit) and stained for intracellular Foxp3 with mouse anti-human Foxp3 monoclonal antibody (0.5 \u03bcg of ab22510; Abcam) or the appropriate isotype control for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin F(ab\u2032)2 secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories) for an additional 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained for surface CD4 expression with PE-labeled anti-CD4 (BD) and CD25 expression with FITC-labeled anti-CD25 (BD). Cells were washed twice and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon, United States).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":33},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":630,"end":635},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":968,"end":971},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1007},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1021},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":1056,"end":1060},"obj":"P01589"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
