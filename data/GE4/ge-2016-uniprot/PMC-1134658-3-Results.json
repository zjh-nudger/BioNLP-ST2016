Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining after culture with or without BMP-6 for 48 hours. Interestingly, BMP-6 showed a small, but reproducible mean increase of cell death from 17 to 23% (n = 5; p \u2264 0,003) in anti-IgM stimulated CD27+ memory B cells. Furthermore, Ramos cells showed a mean increase in cell death from 20 to 50% (n = 3, p < 0,001, figure 3) after BMP-6 treatment. In contrast, cell death of total CD19+ cells (n = 6; p \u2264 0,32; data not shown) or CD27-IgG- na\u00efve B cells was not significantly affected (n = 5; p \u2264 0,65, figure 2).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":102,"end":105},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":102,"end":105},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":102,"end":107},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":102,"end":105},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":102,"end":105},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":253,"end":256},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":253,"end":256},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":253,"end":256},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":253,"end":256},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":253,"end":258},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":288,"end":291},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":288,"end":291},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":288,"end":291},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":288,"end":291},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":288,"end":293},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":412,"end":416},"obj":"P26842"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":546,"end":551},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":546,"end":549},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":546,"end":549},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":546,"end":549},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":546,"end":549},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":596,"end":600},"obj":"P15391"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":645,"end":649},"obj":"P26842"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
