In this study, we show that the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) induces the expression of the Runt-related transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 in CD4+ T cells. This induction seems to be a prerequisite for the binding of RUNX1 and RUNX3 to three putative RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter. Inactivation of the gene encoding RUNX cofactor core-binding factor-\u03b2 (CBF\u03b2) in mice and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 in human T cells resulted in reduced expression of Foxp3. The in vivo conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into Foxp3+ iT reg cells was significantly decreased in adoptively transferred CbfbF/F CD4-cre naive T cells into Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Both RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA silenced human T reg cells and CbfbF/F CD4-cre mouse T reg cells showed diminished suppressive function in vitro. Circulating human CD4+ CD25high CD127\u2212 T reg cells significantly expressed higher levels of RUNX3, FOXP3, and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA compared with CD4+CD25\u2212 cells. Furthermore, FOXP3 and RUNX3 were colocalized in human tonsil T reg cells. These data demonstrate Runx transcription factors as a molecular link in TGF-\u03b2\u2013induced Foxp3 expression in iT reg cell differentiation and function.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":27},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":32,"end":37},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":135,"end":140},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":142,"end":145},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":282,"end":310},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":312,"end":317},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":349,"end":383},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":349,"end":383},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":349,"end":383},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":384,"end":389},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":394,"end":399},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":403,"end":406},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":478,"end":483},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":488,"end":493},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":512,"end":516},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":512,"end":516},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":512,"end":516},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":538,"end":543},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":588,"end":592},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":588,"end":592},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":588,"end":592},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":625,"end":629},"obj":"Q13951"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":697,"end":702},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":707,"end":712},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":764,"end":769},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":803,"end":806},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":821,"end":826},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":903,"end":906},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":907,"end":910},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":930,"end":934},"obj":"P55895"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":949,"end":954},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":959,"end":964},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1013},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1014,"end":1017},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1106},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1122},"obj":"P16871"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1177,"end":1182},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1184,"end":1189},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1195,"end":1200},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1223},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1228},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1255},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1260,"end":1265},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1335,"end":1339},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1335,"end":1339},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1335,"end":1339},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1390},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1399,"end":1404},"obj":"Q9BZS1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
