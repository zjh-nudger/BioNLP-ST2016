At 0, 1 and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the expression of Il12p40 (A,B), Il6 (C,D), Gmcsf (E,F), and Ifnb (G,H) mRNA. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SD. Data are representative of two independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":330,"end":333},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":341,"end":346},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
