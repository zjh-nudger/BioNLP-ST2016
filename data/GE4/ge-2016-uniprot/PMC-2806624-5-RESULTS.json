To target all Runx proteins that might be involved in the induction of Foxp3, we used mice in which loxP-flanked Cbfb alleles were inactivated in T cells through expression of a CD4-cre transgene. Retinoic acid and TGF-\u03b2 synergize in the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells (Kang et al., 2007). To investigate whether Runx-mediated induction of Foxp3 is dependent on the expression of CBF\u03b2, naive CD4+ CD8\u2212 T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, retinoic acid, and increasing concentrations of TGF-\u03b2. After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin and analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-\u03b3 expression. TGF-\u03b2 induced Foxp3 in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre cells in a dose dependent manner, and this was significantly reduced in CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells. Retinoic acid enhanced Foxp3 expression even in 20 pg/ml of TGF-\u03b2 and more than 95% of the CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice became Foxp3+ in 100 and 500 pg/ml TGF-\u03b2 doses. The induction of Foxp3 was again significantly lower in CbfbF/F CD4-cre CD4+ T cells even in the presence of retinoic acid, demonstrating that deficiency in Runx binding to DNA affects the TGF-\u03b2 induction of Foxp3 in T reg cells (Fig. 5 A). There was no difference in the induction of Foxp3 when endogenous IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 were neutralized (Fig. S6).\nThe importance of RUNX transcription factors for the in vivo conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into iT reg cells was examined. Control CbfbF/F or CbfbF/F CD4-cre naive T cells, harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele were adoptively transferred into Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice. 6 wk later, CD4+ T cells in spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and lamina propria of the small intestine were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression (Fig. 5 B). There was a consistently lower percentage of CD4+ T cells that had developed Foxp3 expression in the mesenteric lymph node and lamina propria of mice transferred with CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5, B and C). These data affirm the significance of RUNX proteins for the in vivo generation of CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":8,"end":12},"obj":"Q13951"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":39,"end":43},"obj":"Q13951"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":70,"end":74},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":70,"end":74},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":70,"end":74},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":180,"end":184},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":180,"end":184},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":180,"end":184},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":237,"end":242},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":279,"end":283},"obj":"Q13951"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":344,"end":347},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":348,"end":351},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":381,"end":386},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":417,"end":422},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":484,"end":488},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":484,"end":488},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":484,"end":488},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":511,"end":516},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":551,"end":555},"obj":"Q13951"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":563,"end":566},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":594,"end":597},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":598,"end":601},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":622,"end":625},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":626,"end":629},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":661,"end":664},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":661,"end":664},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":661,"end":664},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":661,"end":664},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":722,"end":727},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":833,"end":838},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":843,"end":848},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":861,"end":866},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":875,"end":880},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":892,"end":895},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":896,"end":899},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":980,"end":983},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":984,"end":987},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1018,"end":1023},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1055,"end":1060},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1086,"end":1089},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1115},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1119},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1137},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1165},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1195},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1240},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1241,"end":1244},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1248},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1334},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1334},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1334},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":1362,"end":1367},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":1381,"end":1386},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":1458,"end":1463},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":1480,"end":1484},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":1489,"end":1494},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":1541,"end":1545},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":1541,"end":1545},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":1541,"end":1545},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":1604,"end":1607},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":1676,"end":1679},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":1680,"end":1683},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":1711,"end":1716},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":1722,"end":1725},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":1766,"end":1770},"obj":"P55895"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":1792,"end":1795},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":1899,"end":1904},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":1905,"end":1908},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":1977,"end":1980},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":2009,"end":2014},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":2107,"end":2110},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":2111,"end":2114},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin":2206,"end":2210},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T77","span":{
