CD14 positive monocytes from CF patients and healthy controls showed a significant increase in caspase-1 activation upon stimulation with LPS+ATP, PAO1, and LPS+Poly(dA:dT) (Fig. 4a) but this activation was not different between CF and control subjects (Fig. 4b).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"P08571"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":181,"end":185},"obj":"P08571"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":211,"end":215},"obj":"P08571"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
