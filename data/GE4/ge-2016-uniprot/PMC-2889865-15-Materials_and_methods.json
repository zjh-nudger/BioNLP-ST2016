The following primer sequences were used, il-6: forward- TGTGAAAGCAGCAAAGAGGCACTG, reverse- ACAGCTCTGGCTTGTTCCTCACTA; cxcl8: forward- ACCACACTGCGCCAACACAGAAAT, reverse- AAACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTGCAC. Thermocycling conditions for CYBR Green (Quanta, USA) consisted of a denaturation step for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 60 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1s and 60\u00b0C for 30s. Gene expression was analysed using Stratagene (Mx3000p\u2122) (AH diagnostics). The obtained Ct values were normalized against 18S. Initially, all measured 18S Ct values were used to calculate a mean Ct value that was used to determine the \u0394Ct values for each sample. Gene expression patterns for il-6 and cxcl8 were then normalized with regard to the samples 18S \u0394Ct.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":105,"end":109},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":114,"end":119},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":225,"end":229},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":301,"end":306},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":832,"end":836},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":841,"end":846},"obj":"P10145"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
