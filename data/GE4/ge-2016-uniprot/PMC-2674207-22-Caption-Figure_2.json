A positive control for GR association with importin is shown. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. *** p<0.001 compared to control, ### p<0.001. (B) Western blot analysis demonstrated a time- (at 10\u22128 M FP) and concentration- (at 60 min after stimulation) dependent induction of FP-activated GR nuclear translocation measured by IP. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. ***p<0.001 compared to control. (C) Western blot analysis of HuT-78 cells treated with FP and anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association at 20 min. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to \u03b1CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) GFP-tagged GATA-3 was overexpressed and cells stimulated (b, c) or not (a) for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of 30 min pretreatment of cells with FP (10\u22128 M, c) is also shown. All data were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":37},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":76},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":240,"end":242},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":303,"end":305},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":663,"end":665},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":931,"end":934},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":931,"end":934},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":931,"end":934},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":931,"end":934},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":935,"end":939},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1012},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1235,"end":1239},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1265},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1279},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1358,"end":1361},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1358,"end":1361},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1358,"end":1361},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1358,"end":1361},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1362,"end":1366},"obj":"P10747"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
