The expression of various cell surface molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry as described in materials and methods. Both forms of dCGN clearly stimulated expression of ICAM-1 (CD54) on PBM and THP-1 cells (Fig. 4A). The increase in ICAM-1 expression was higher on THP-1 cells treated with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B). Another surface antigen, the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (CD58) was slightly reduced on PBM after treatment with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules of class I (HLA-ABC) and of class II (HLA-DR), as well as the monocyte marker CD14, seemed to be reduced by treatment with dCGN (Fig. 4B). However, these differences were not statistically significant.\nTreatment with dCGN also induced a strong aggregation of monocytes, detected by phase contrast inverse microscopy (Fig. 5). Although this effect was easily observed in monocytes incubated with the 10 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5B), a more robust cell aggregation was observed in monocytes incubated with the 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5C). ICAM-1 has been proposed to be the main adhesion molecule responsible for monocyte aggregation. To confirm this, monocytes were incubated with both types of dCGN in the presence of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody, an anti-CD58 antibody and an isotype control IgG1 antibody. The anti-ICAM-1 antibody effectively blocked the cell aggregates induced by dCGN (Fig. 5D, 5E), strongly suggesting that indeed ICAM-1 is responsible for monocyte aggregation. Both the control IgG1 and the anti-CD58 antibody did not modify monocyte aggregation (data not shown).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":432,"end":438},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":496,"end":502},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":605,"end":645},"obj":"P19256"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":647,"end":651},"obj":"P19256"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":875,"end":879},"obj":"P08571"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1324},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":1507,"end":1513},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":1532,"end":1536},"obj":"P19256"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":1593,"end":1599},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1712,"end":1718},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1795,"end":1799},"obj":"P19256"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
