We therefore quantitated the Foxp3 protein expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells by flow cytometry and the HTLV-I proviral load (a surrogate marker of viral replication) by real-time PCR from eight patients with HAM/TSP and eight asymptomatic carriers (ACs). The data from this analysis is summarized in Table 1. As expected, patients with HAM/TSP exhibited significantly higher proviral loads (indicated as HTLV-I proviral DNA copies/100 cells) (34.68 \u00b1 23.19) compared to ACs (4.75 \u00b1 5.47) (p = 0.0008). The percentage of Foxp3+ cells within the CD4+CD25+ T cell population was significantly greater in ACs (43.23 \u00b1 12.95) than in HAM/TSP patients (18.59 \u00b1 5.77) (p = 0.0033). These data suggest that high levels of Foxp3 protein expression are associated with reduced HTLV-I replication in vivo. They also support our recent reports that high proviral loads, which have been shown to correlate with high Tax mRNA in HTLV-I-infected patients, are associated with reduced Foxp3 expression [8,34].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":85,"end":90},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":134,"end":138},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":261,"end":266},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":341,"end":346},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":369,"end":372},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":373,"end":377},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":830,"end":835},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":854,"end":857},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":858,"end":862},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1029},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1213,"end":1216},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1279,"end":1284},"obj":"Q9BZS1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
