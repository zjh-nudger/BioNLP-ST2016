To begin evaluating potential contributions of HOIP to CD40 signaling, we assayed the upregulation of CD80 induced by engagement of CD40 on parental A20.2J, HOIP-deficient, and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig. 2). Compared to the parental cell line, the CD40-stimulated upregulation of CD80 was dramatically reduced in all HOIP-deficient cells tested. In contrast, upregulation of CD80 was restored in HOIP-reconstituted cells, confirming that the defect in CD80 upregulation in the HOIP-deficient cells was due to the disruption of Rnf31.\nCD40 signals in B cells can also contribute to the activation of DNA recombination in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus [11], [12]. This process, known as immunoglobulin class switching (or isotype switching), allows B cells, initially expressing IgM, to switch to IgA, IgG, or IgE depending on the class of antibody most appropriate for a particular immune response. Switching to IgE can be induced by the combination of IL-4 and CD40 signals. The gene rearrangement necessary for IgE production is preceded by the production of non-coding RNA transcripts from germline sequences in the IgE heavy chain locus [13]. To determine whether HOIP is required in the initiation of the class switching process, the relevant B cell lines were stimulated through CD40 in the presence of IL-4 and tested for production of germline epsilon (GL\u03b5) transcripts (Fig. 3). Anti-CD40 antibody stimulation alone or together with IL-4 induced GL\u03b5 transcription in parental A20.2J cells as expected. In contrast, only low levels of GL\u03b5 expression were detected in HOIP-deficient cells stimulated with either anti-CD40 antibody alone or anti-CD40 and IL-4. Normal levels of GL\u03b5 expression were induced in HOIP-reconstituted cells stimulated with anti-CD40 antibody alone or together with IL-4. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HOIP has a critical role in cellular responses to CD40 signaling.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":25},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":71,"end":87},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":116,"end":120},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":158,"end":162},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":315,"end":319},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":323,"end":327},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":370,"end":374},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":400,"end":404},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":417,"end":420},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":425,"end":429},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":445,"end":449},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":520,"end":524},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":552,"end":556},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":589,"end":593},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":647,"end":651},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":668,"end":672},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":724,"end":728},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":749,"end":753},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":799,"end":804},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01877"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01860"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01871"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01876"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01880"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01861"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01854"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01857"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":896,"end":922},"obj":"P01859"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1231,"end":1235},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1240,"end":1244},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1446,"end":1450},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1567},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1587,"end":1591},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1621,"end":1637},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1639,"end":1642},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1671,"end":1675},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1720,"end":1724},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1733,"end":1736},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1763,"end":1766},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1821,"end":1824},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1853,"end":1857},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1902,"end":1906},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1930,"end":1934},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1939,"end":1943},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1962,"end":1965},"obj":"Q28322"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1993,"end":1997},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2039,"end":2043},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2076,"end":2080},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2124,"end":2128},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2174,"end":2178},"obj":"P25942"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
