(A) Western analysis of Runx3, Eomes, T-bet, and perforin expression in Runx3+/+ versus Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ SP T cells differentiated for 6 d. \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. (B) Northern blot analysis of Prf1 mRNA expression in Runx3+/+ versus Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells differentiated for 6 d. \u03b2\u2013Actin was used as a loading control. (C) Expression of granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3, TNF, and IL-2 by resting or restimulated (6 h) Runx3+/+ versus Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ SP T cells differentiated for 6 d. The vertical gray line indicates the granzyme B MFI for WT GFP+ cells. Results in A\u2013C are representative of two independent experiments. (D) ChIP analysis of binding of endogenous Runx3 and Eomes to the Prf1 locus. Enrichment of the indicated genomic regions was evaluated by real-time PCR of DNA from immunoprecipitated and input chromatin. The data are the means of duplicate measurements from two chromatin preparations from two independent CD8+ T cell differentiations. The efficiency of recovery of input for the \u22121-kb region of Prf1 was 0.97% for the Runx3 ChIP and 0.5% for the Eomes ChIP.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":18},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":76,"end":81},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":90,"end":95},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":101,"end":109},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":124,"end":129},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":140,"end":145},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":149,"end":152},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":149,"end":152},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":189,"end":196},"obj":"P60709"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":258,"end":262},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":282,"end":287},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":298,"end":303},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":307,"end":310},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":307,"end":310},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":344,"end":351},"obj":"P60709"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":401,"end":411},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":413,"end":418},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":420,"end":423},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":429,"end":433},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":467,"end":472},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":483,"end":488},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":492,"end":495},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":492,"end":495},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":569,"end":579},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":591,"end":594},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":712,"end":717},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":722,"end":727},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":735,"end":739},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":976,"end":979},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":976,"end":979},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1070},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1089,"end":1094},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1122},"obj":"O95936"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
