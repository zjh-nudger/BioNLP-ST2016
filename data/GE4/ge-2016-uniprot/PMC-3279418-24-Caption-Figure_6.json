At 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, whole-cell lysates were obtained and subject to immunoblots with antibodies against proteins involved in NF-\u03baB, TBK1/IRF3, ERK1/2, and p38 signaling pathways. Beta-actin was used as loading control. (C) Cellular levels of p-IKK1/2 and p-I\u03baB\u03b1 in LPS- or poly I:C-stimulated BMDC were quantitated with ImageJ (NIH) and presented as trend lines. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":308,"end":312},"obj":"Q9UHD2"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":313,"end":317},"obj":"Q14653"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":319,"end":323},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":331,"end":334},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":331,"end":334},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":331,"end":334},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":331,"end":334},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":355,"end":365},"obj":"P60709"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":420,"end":424},"obj":"O15111"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":420,"end":424},"obj":"Q60680-2"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"obj":"P25963"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
