Experimental setup (A) and results of the mouse suppression assay (B), FACS-purified naive CD4+8\u2212 T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre (left) and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2; right) were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAb, 50 U/ml IL-2, and 2.5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2. After 3 d, Foxp3-GFP+ cells were FACS-sorted and mixed with CFSE-loaded naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells at the indicated ratios. These were then incubated with inactivated splenocytes and anti-CD3 mAb. After a further 4 d, CD45.1+ cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution. (C) As a control, CbfbF/+ CD4-cre CD4+ T cells activated in absence of TGF-\u03b2 were mixed with CFSE-loaded naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells at the indicated ratios. Four days later CD45.1+ cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution. The median division number (of the naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells in the cultures containing Foxp3-GFP+ cells) is indicated in each of the histograms. One of three experiments is shown. (D) Human naive CD4+ T cells, transfected with RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA and cultured under iT reg differentiating conditions were used in an in vitro suppression assay, cultured together with autologous CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells, and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. The CFSE dilution of the CD4+ T cell responder cells was analyzed after 5 d by flow cytometry. The T reg/responder CD4+ T cell ratios used were 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5. One of two experiments is shown.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":8,"end":11},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":12,"end":15},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":72,"end":75},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":121,"end":126},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":269,"end":272},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":297,"end":300},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":301,"end":304},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":332,"end":335},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":336,"end":339},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":346,"end":350},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":415,"end":419},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":435,"end":440},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":453,"end":458},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":459,"end":462},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":520,"end":524},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":628,"end":631},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":628,"end":631},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":628,"end":631},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":628,"end":631},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":658,"end":662},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":731,"end":734},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":735,"end":738},"obj":"P06956"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":739,"end":742},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":776,"end":781},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":824,"end":827},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":876,"end":880},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":964,"end":968},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":972,"end":975},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1015},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1019},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1119,"end":1122},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1155},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1165},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1319},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1358},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1358},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1358},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1358},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1389,"end":1392},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1479,"end":1482},"obj":"P01730"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
