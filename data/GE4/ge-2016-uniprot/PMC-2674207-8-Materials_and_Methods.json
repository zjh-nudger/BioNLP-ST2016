Similarly, GATA-3 was isolated from nonstimulated HuT-78 cells or cells stimulated for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28 and GR was isolated from FP (10\u22128 M, 30 min) stimulated HuT-78 cells. These proteins were subsequently refolded in glycine solution. 100 \u00b5l of importin-\u03b1 solution (100 ng/ml in TBS) was added to 96-well plates coated with goat anti-importin-\u03b1 antibody. After 1 h incubation, GATA-3 (100 ng/ml in TBS) from stimulated or unstimulated cells were added to the importin-\u03b1-coated wells. GR (10 or 100 ng/ml in TBS) from stimulated or unstimulated cells were added to some wells. After a further 1 h incubation, the plate was washed and incubated with primary antibodies (a mixture of rabbit anti-GATA-3 and mouse anti-GR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h, and then incubated with secondary antibodies. FITC swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Cambridge, UK) was used for the detection of GATA-3, and rhodamine donkey anti-mouse IgG (Novus, Littleton, Colorado, USA) was used for the detection of GR. FITC and rhodamine levels were measured with a fluorescent micro-plate reader (Bioline, London, UK).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":2},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":3,"end":9},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":259,"end":265},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":352,"end":355},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":352,"end":355},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":352,"end":355},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":352,"end":355},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":356,"end":360},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":365,"end":367},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":636,"end":642},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":743,"end":745},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":952,"end":958},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":974,"end":976},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1140,"end":1146},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1248,"end":1250},"obj":"P04150"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
