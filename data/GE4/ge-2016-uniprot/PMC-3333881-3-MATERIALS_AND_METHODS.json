PBMCs were isolated as previously described (53). Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2\u2009mM l-glutamine (Lonza Cologne AG, Germany). HeLa, p50\u2212/\u2212p65\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and 293T were transfected with DNA by using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol; total DNA amounts were equalized by transfection of pRc/CMV empty vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For pulse-stimulation, HeLa cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) (20\u2009ng/ml) for 5\u2009min, or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1; Sigma-Aldrich) (20\u2009ng/ml) for 30\u2009min, washed twice in complete culture medium and then returned to culture. For luciferase assays, pSV-\u03b2-Gal was co-transfected with p\u03baBluc to monitor the transfection efficiency. Forty-eight-hour post-transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer of Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix, Bedford, MA, USA) and the luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities were evaluated by using Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix) in a bioluminometer (Turner Biosystem, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to \u03b2-galactosidase activity was expressed as relative light units.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":36,"end":46},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":59,"end":62},"obj":"P19838"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":65,"end":68},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":65,"end":68},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":453,"end":456},"obj":"P19838"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":459,"end":462},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":459,"end":462},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":866,"end":887},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":891,"end":896},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":891,"end":894},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1020},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1203},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1246,"end":1256},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1333},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1431,"end":1441},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1504},"obj":"Q04864"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
