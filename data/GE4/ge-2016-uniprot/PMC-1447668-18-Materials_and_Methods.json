Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK 293T cells transfected with a control vector (EGFP) or Foxp3 expression vector (1,000 ng) in the presence or absence of forskolin (10 \u03bcM for 4 h) using the TransFactor Extraction Kit (BD Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using a Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclear extracts (20 \u03bcg) were incubated in preblocked wells containing plate-bound double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to an ATF/CREB consensus sequence (\u2026TGACATCA\u2026). Wells were washed, incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, washed, incubated with secondary antibody (HRP-labeled), washed again, and finally developed with TMB substrate. Colorimetric reactions were read using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at an absorbance of 655 nm.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":54,"end":60},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":65,"end":70},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":311,"end":316},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":687,"end":691},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":687,"end":691},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":687,"end":691},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":687,"end":691},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":687,"end":691},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":687,"end":691},"obj":"O43889"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
