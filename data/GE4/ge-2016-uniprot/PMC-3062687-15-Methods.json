Bacterially purified glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-I\u03baB\u03b1 (1-54), wild type, mutant GST-RPS3, or RPS3 proteins were used as substrates. The in vitro kinase assay was performed as previously described29. Briefly, enzyme (100 ng) and substrate (2 \u03bcg) were co-incubated in IKK reaction buffer (25 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM ATP) or NleH1 reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP) with 0.5 \u03bcCi 32P-\u03b3-ATP (GE Healthcare) added at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The reactions were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":48,"end":52},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":191,"end":195},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":226,"end":230},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":235,"end":239},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":445,"end":447},"obj":"P0A7Z4"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":514,"end":519},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":553,"end":555},"obj":"P0A7Z4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
