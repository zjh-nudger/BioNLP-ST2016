There was no significant increase upon stimulation with live PAO1 or LPS+ATP at the times examined (Fig. 3a\u2013b). Because previous studies have indicated a role for caspase-1 in the activation of NF-\u03baB through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [35], we examined whether chemical inhibition of caspase-1 altered NF-\u03baB-dependent IL-6 production in response to P. aeruginosa. However, treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk (YVAD) did not decrease IL-6 secretion by airway epithelial cells (Fig. 3c).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":562,"end":566},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":691,"end":695},"obj":"P05231"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
