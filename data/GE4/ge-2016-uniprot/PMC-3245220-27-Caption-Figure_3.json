As a control, untreated cells were incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody recognizing the active cleaved form of caspase-3. The blots were reblotted with \u03b2-actin that served as a loading control. The ratio of active caspase-3 bands (17 kD and 19 kD) to \u03b2-actin control was determined by densitometry analysis (bottom panel). Data represents the mean \u00b1 S.E.M from two independent donors. (B) Apoptosis of the treated MDMs was also measured by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of surviving cells (Annexin V/PI negative) for the cells treated with vehicle/M-CSF was arbitrarily set as 100. Data shown represent the mean \u00b1 S.E.M from three independent experiments. *The p-values of inhibitors/M-CSF compared to vehicle/M-CSF were \u22640.05.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":211,"end":216},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":213,"end":216},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":405,"end":414},"obj":"P42574"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":446,"end":453},"obj":"P60709"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":508,"end":517},"obj":"P42574"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":545,"end":552},"obj":"P60709"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":734,"end":743},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":851,"end":860},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":909,"end":914},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":911,"end":914},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1050},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1050},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1071,"end":1076},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1076},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
