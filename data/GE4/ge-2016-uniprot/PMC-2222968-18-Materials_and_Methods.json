After 4 h, the cells were washed and activated with soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and TGF-\u03b2 (10 ng/ml). Each day, the TAT proteins were freshly added to the medium. FOXP3 expression was measured after 5 d by intracellular staining.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":4,"end":9},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":24,"end":27},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":28,"end":34},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":143,"end":148},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":251,"end":255},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":260,"end":265},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"obj":"Q9BZS1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
