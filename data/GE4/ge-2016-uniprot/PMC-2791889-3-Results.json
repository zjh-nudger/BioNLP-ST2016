Naive CD4+ D011.10 T\u00a0cells deficient in STAT4 (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 1998) were cultured in the presence of IL-12 and OVA. Again, IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated at the high antigen dose in the presence of IL-12 in DO11.10 T\u00a0cells (Figure\u00a02A). In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL-4, but not IL-10 (Figure\u00a02A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL-10 expression by Th1 cells.\nBecause IL-10 expression is associated with an IL-4-induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL-4 receptor via STAT6 activation (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy et\u00a0al., 2000). The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (Figure\u00a02A). In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure\u00a02A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response. As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL-4 and IL-10 production by T\u00a0cells developed with IL-4 or with low antigen dose (Figures 2B and 2C). However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL-10 and IL-4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased (Figures 2B and 2C). Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL-10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling (Figures 2B and 2C).\nTo investigate whether the inability of STAT4-deficient T\u00a0cells to produce IL-10 might be due to the absence of IFN-\u03b3, as suggested before (Shaw et\u00a0al., 2006), we differentiated DO11.10 or DO11.10 IFN-\u03b3-deficient naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells in the presence of IL-12 and increasing doses of OVA. The secretion of IL-10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL-12 was not affected by an absence of IFN-\u03b3 (Figure\u00a02D), showing that the expression of\u00a0IL-10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN-\u03b3. In the absence of IFN-\u03b3, we observed an increase in the secreted IL-4 as expected (data not shown).\nWe also tested for any potential role of IL-4 in the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 by culturing DO11.10 or DO11.10 IL-4-deficient naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells with IL-12 and increasing doses of antigen. As observed in the absence of STAT6 (Figure\u00a02A), IL-4 deficiency had no effect on the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 (Figure\u00a02E), but compromised the development of Th2 cells producing IL-10 (Figure\u00a02F). Thus, our data suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 or Th2 cells was dependent on the specific signaling pathways required for their differentiation, given that STAT4 is required for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells and STAT6 for Th2 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":46,"end":51},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":63,"end":68},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":70,"end":75},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":80,"end":84},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":183,"end":188},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":218,"end":223},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":268,"end":273},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":268,"end":273},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":303,"end":306},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":337,"end":342},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":398,"end":403},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":398,"end":403},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":420,"end":425},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":510,"end":515},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":510,"end":515},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":579,"end":584},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":621,"end":626},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":733,"end":737},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":747,"end":752},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":782,"end":787},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":803,"end":808},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":842,"end":847},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":881,"end":885},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":965,"end":970},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1025,"end":1029},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1048},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1130},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1169,"end":1174},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1219},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1219},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1227},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1278},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1332,"end":1337},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1342,"end":1347},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1464,"end":1469},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1485,"end":1489},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1494,"end":1499},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1537,"end":1541},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1615,"end":1620},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1632,"end":1637},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1642,"end":1646},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1779,"end":1784},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1821,"end":1826},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1839,"end":1844},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1917,"end":1922},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1952,"end":1957},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1989,"end":1994},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2074,"end":2079},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2096,"end":2099},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2128,"end":2133},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2128,"end":2133},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2158,"end":2161},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":2180,"end":2185},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":2223,"end":2228},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":2223,"end":2228},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":2263,"end":2268},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":2313,"end":2318},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":2350,"end":2355},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":2375,"end":2380},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":2422,"end":2426},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":2498,"end":2502},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":2545,"end":2550},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":2583,"end":2587},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":2604,"end":2607},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":2622,"end":2627},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":2622,"end":2627},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":2691,"end":2696},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":2710,"end":2714},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":2782,"end":2787},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":2856,"end":2861},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":2905,"end":2910},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":3038,"end":3043},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":3077,"end":3082},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin":3111,"end":3116},"obj":"P4222
