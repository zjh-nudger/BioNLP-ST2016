We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells. Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (Figure 5A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B). Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [3]. However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression. Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 at high IL-4 concentration (Figure 5A and 5B). The IL-4\u2013mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-\u03b2, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-\u03b2 signaling were functional under these conditions (Figure 5C). Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (Figure 5D). Furthermore, injection of IL-4 into wild-type B6 mice decreased the inducible or natural Treg number in vivo. A distinction of the Treg subsets is not possible, because recently activated iTreg cells also express surface CD25. We used complexes of recombinant mouse IL-4 (rmIL-4) plus anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which have been shown to dramatically increase the potency of the cytokine in vivo [19]. In these mice, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ and FOXP3+ T cells dramatically decreased when the antibody-cytokine immune complexes were injected (Figure S2). Upon administration of rmIL-4 plus anti-IL-4 mAb complexes, the total number of CD4+CD25+ T cell, as well as the Foxp3+ T cells diminished by half (Figure S2G and S2H), confirming that the lower percentage was not due to an increase in the CD4+CD25\u2013 cells, but a real decrease of CD4+CD25+ T cells. In conclusion, IL-4 negatively regulates the natural or inducible Treg cell turnover not only in vitro but also in vivo. To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells (nTreg cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity. In already-existing Treg cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (Figure S3C). Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (Figure S3B).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":46,"end":50},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":171,"end":175},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":179,"end":183},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":195,"end":200},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":214,"end":219},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":263,"end":266},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":267,"end":273},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":320,"end":323},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":320,"end":323},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":320,"end":323},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":320,"end":323},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":348,"end":353},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":361,"end":365},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":391,"end":395},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":422,"end":427},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":450,"end":455},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":542,"end":547},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":584,"end":588},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":656,"end":660},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":665,"end":669},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":691,"end":696},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":718,"end":723},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":760,"end":765},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":774,"end":778},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":817,"end":821},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":845,"end":850},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":952,"end":957},"obj":"Q15796"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":961,"end":966},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1003,"end":1007},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1015,"end":1020},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1050},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1062,"end":1067},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1152,"end":1156},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1180,"end":1185},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1195,"end":1200},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1294,"end":1298},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1489,"end":1493},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1534,"end":1538},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1558,"end":1562},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1715,"end":1718},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1719,"end":1723},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1729,"end":1734},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1878,"end":1882},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1918,"end":1921},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1922,"end":1926},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1951,"end":1956},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2078,"end":2081},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2082,"end":2086},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2118,"end":2121},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2122,"end":2126},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2152,"end":2156},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":2282,"end":2286},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":2364,"end":2368},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":2395,"end":2399},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":2413,"end":2418},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":2488,"end":2492},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":2511,"end":2516},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":2653,"end":2658},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":2675,"end":2679},"obj":"P05112"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
