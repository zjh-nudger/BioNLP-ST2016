Type I receptors can signal via several pathways. We examined the effect of BMP-6 on Smad phosphorylation, as the activation of Smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for BMPs [17]. B cells were cultured in serum-free media over night and then treated with BMP-6 for various time points. Total protein lysates were prepared, and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of Smad1/5/8 were determined by western blot analysis. Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad. The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5). A similar phosphorylation was observed in Ramos cells, but not in HL60 cells (Figure 6). Furthermore, we also tested whether other known downstream signalling pathways of BMP-6 could be triggered by BMP-6 in human B cells. However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"obj":"Q15797"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":216,"end":219},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":216,"end":221},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":216,"end":219},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":216,"end":219},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":216,"end":219},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":410,"end":413},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":410,"end":413},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":410,"end":413},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":410,"end":413},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":410,"end":415},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":525,"end":530},"obj":"Q15797"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":617,"end":620},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":617,"end":620},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":617,"end":620},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":617,"end":620},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":617,"end":622},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":660,"end":663},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":660,"end":663},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":660,"end":663},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":660,"end":663},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":660,"end":665},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":970,"end":973},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":970,"end":973},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":970,"end":975},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":970,"end":973},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":970,"end":973},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":998,"end":1003},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"obj":"P40763"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1118},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1118},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1118},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1118},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1127},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1127},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1127},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1127},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1129},"obj":"P22004"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
