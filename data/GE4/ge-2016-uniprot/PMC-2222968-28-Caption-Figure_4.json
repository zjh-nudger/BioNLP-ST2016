The cells were harvested at different time points, and mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR for FOXP3 and GATA3 expression. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments.\n(B) Intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining is shown after exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to differentiating conditions as in part A of the figure. Data are representative of three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":61,"end":64},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":65,"end":71},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":118,"end":121},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":118,"end":121},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":118,"end":121},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":118,"end":121},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":122,"end":126},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":146,"end":151},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":165,"end":169},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":278,"end":283},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":288,"end":293},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":382,"end":387},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":392,"end":397},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":434,"end":437},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":438,"end":444},"obj":"P08575"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
