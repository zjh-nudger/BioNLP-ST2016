After the coincubation period, cells were stained with Annexin V\u2013FITC and anti-CD8\u2013allophycocyanin. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.); EL4 target cells (CD8-negative events) were gated, and the percentage of Annexin V+ target cells was determined.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":164,"end":167},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":164,"end":167},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":322,"end":331},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":346,"end":349},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":346,"end":349},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":453,"end":456},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":453,"end":456},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":508,"end":517},"obj":"P08758"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
