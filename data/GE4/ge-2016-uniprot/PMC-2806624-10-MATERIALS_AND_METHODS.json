For Th1 differentiation conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-4, and 25 ng/ml IL-12 (R&D Systems). For Th2 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 25 ng/ml IL-4, and 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12 (R&D Systems). For T reg cell conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-4. For Th17 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 20 ng/ml IL-6, 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2, 20 ng/ml IL-23 (Alexis Biochemicals Corp.), 10 ng/ml IL-1\u03b2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti-IL-4, and 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12 were used. Proliferating cells were expanded in medium containing IL-2. The cytokine profile of these cells demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 is the predominant cytokine in Th1 cells, IL-4 and IL-13 in Th2 cells, and IL-17 in Th17 cells (Akdis et al., 2000; Burgler et al., 2009).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":36},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":44},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":67,"end":73},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":175},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":172,"end":175},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":172,"end":175},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":172,"end":175},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":310,"end":314},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":329,"end":333},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":348,"end":353},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":348,"end":353},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":440,"end":444},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":455,"end":459},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":478,"end":483},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":478,"end":483},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":577,"end":581},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":591,"end":596},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":611,"end":616},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":611,"end":616},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":631,"end":635},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":709,"end":713},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":724,"end":728},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":738,"end":743},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":798,"end":803},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":818,"end":822},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":841,"end":846},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":841,"end":846},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":913,"end":917},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":973,"end":978},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1025},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1035},"obj":"P35225"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1054,"end":1059},"obj":"Q16552"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
