Bcl10 is a signalling protein that acts upstream of NF-\u03baB in concert with CARMA1 and MALT1 and has been suggested to directly regulate NF-\u03baB activity in T-cells [27]. Therefore, Bcl10 activation was evaluated in both control and PMA stimulated cells after 10 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h using western blot analysis. The Bcl10 levels decreased following treatment with PMA, while in control cells, Bcl10 returned to higher levels by 24 h (figure 7c). This suggests that Bcl10 is involved in the PMA dependent inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":38,"end":43},"obj":"O95999"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"Q15653"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":252,"end":257},"obj":"O95999"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":326,"end":332},"obj":"Q9BXL7"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":337,"end":342},"obj":"Q9UDY8"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":430,"end":435},"obj":"O95999"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":568,"end":573},"obj":"O95999"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":645,"end":650},"obj":"O95999"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":717,"end":722},"obj":"O95999"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
