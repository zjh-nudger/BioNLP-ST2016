(A) In absence of Tat, I\u03baB-\u03b1 occupies the NF-\u03baB enhancer of the MIP-1\u03b1 promoter and likely interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as HDACs (65), to inhibit gene transcription. (B) Tat activates the MIP-1\u03b1 expression by removing the I\u03baB-\u03b1 repressor from the NF-\u03baB enhancer, and by increasing the binding of p65 NF-\u03baB complex to the NF-\u03baB enhancer.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":9,"end":15},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":75,"end":78},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":75,"end":78},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":75,"end":78},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":75,"end":78},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":121,"end":127},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":246,"end":249},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":246,"end":249},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":246,"end":249},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":246,"end":249},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":264,"end":270},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":372,"end":375},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":372,"end":375},"obj":"P21579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
