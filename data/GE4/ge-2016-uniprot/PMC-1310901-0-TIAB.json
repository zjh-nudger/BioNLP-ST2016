Promoter methylation of CpG target sites or direct deletions/insertions of genes are mechanisms of a reversible or permanent silencing of gene expression, respectively. Therefore, we investigated whether IRF-4 promoter methylation or mutation may be involved in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells. Whereas promoter mutations or structural rearrangements could be excluded as a cause of altered IRF-4 expression in hematopoietic cells, the IRF-4 promoter methylation status was found to significantly influence IRF-4 transcription. First, treatment of IRF-4-negative lymphoid, myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation-inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase of IRF-4 mRNA and protein levels. Second, using a restriction-PCR-assay and bisulfite-sequencing we identified specifically methylated CpG sites in IRF-4-negative but not in IRF-4-positive cells. Third, we clearly determined promoter methylation as a mechanism for IRF-4 down-regulation via reporter gene assays, but did not detect an association of methylational status and mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases or methyl-CpG-binding proteins. Together, these data suggest CpG site-specific IRF-4 promoter methylation as a putative mechanism of down-regulated IRF-4 expression in leukemia.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":49},"obj":"Q02556"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":19,"end":49},"obj":"Q14653"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":19,"end":49},"obj":"Q92985"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":19,"end":49},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":19,"end":49},"obj":"Q13568"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":158,"end":161},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":162,"end":165},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":367,"end":397},"obj":"Q02556"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":367,"end":397},"obj":"Q92985"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":367,"end":397},"obj":"Q14653"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":367,"end":397},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":367,"end":397},"obj":"Q13568"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":399,"end":404},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":734,"end":739},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":866,"end":871},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":911,"end":916},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":982,"end":987},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1028},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1194,"end":1199},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1344},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1365,"end":1370},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1456,"end":1461},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1607},"obj":"O95243"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1607},"obj":"Q9UBB5"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1607},"obj":"Q9UIS9"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1607},"obj":"Q9Y6K1"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1607},"obj":"Q9UBC3"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1607},"obj":"P26358"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1611,"end":1638},"obj":"P51608"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1687,"end":1692},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1756,"end":1761},"obj":"Q15306"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
