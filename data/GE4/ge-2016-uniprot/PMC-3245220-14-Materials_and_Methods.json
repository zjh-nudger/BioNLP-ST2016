Monocytes used in real time PCR experiments and transfection experiments were purified by positive selection using CD14 Monocyte Isolation Kit from Miltenyi Biotech (Auburn, CA) (>90% pure). In some experiments, monocytes were isolated by clumping method (70% pure). To obtain monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), monocytes were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, and 10 \u00b5g/ml polymyxin B and 20 ng/ml M-CSF.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":317,"end":321},"obj":"P08571"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":618,"end":623},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":620,"end":623},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
