FP (10\u22128 M) treatment of HuT-78 cells activated by anti-CD3/CD28 in vitro significantly decreased p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Figure 3A) and activity measured by phosphorylation of the downstream target ATF-2 (Figure 3B). This effect was detected at 30 min and lasted for at least 14 h (Figure 3B). FP (10\u22128 M) also significantly reduced GATA-3 serine phosphorylation induced by anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3C). This reduction in GATA-3 phosphorylation was also seen with lower concentrations of FP. We found that FP significantly induced MKP-1 mRNA in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner, reaching a plateau at 10\u22128 M after 10 min (Figure 3D and 3E). However, the effects of FP on GATA-3 nuclear import, importin-\u03b1 association and IL-4 mRNA expression are seen at 10,000-fold lower concentrations (10\u221212 M, see Figure 2).\nUsing an in vitro competition assay (Figure 4A) utilizing purified activated GATA-3, importin-\u03b1, and activated GR, we demonstrated that activated GR significantly increased GR-importin-\u03b1 association in the presence and absence of activated GATA-3 (Figure 4B). This effect is not mutual, since activated GATA-3 did not block GR\u2013importin-\u03b1 association (Figure 4C). These data also suggest that both activated GR and phospho-GATA-3 can directly associate with importin-\u03b1 (Figure 4D) and that activated GR attenuates the phospho-GATA-3/importin-\u03b1 interaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4E). Together, this suggests that ligand-activated GR may compete with phospho-GATA-3 for importin-\u03b1 and thereby limit GATA-3 nuclear import.\nOther possible interpretations of our results could include an effect of FP on GATA-3 nuclear export and/or degradation. Leptomycin B, which inhibits nuclear export, did not affect the ability of FP to block GATA-3 nuclear localization (Figure 5A). Additionally, FP had no effect on whole cell GATA-3 expression during the time course of these experiments (Figure 5B). Nor did addition of FP subsequent to anti-CD3/CD28 nuclear translocation affect GATA-3 nuclear residency (Figure 5C), suggesting that activated GR does not enhance GATA-3 nuclear export. Finally, the effect of FP on GATA-3 nuclear import was not nonspecific, since FP (10\u22128 M) had no effect on p65 nuclear translocation measured at 60 min (Figure 5D).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"P28562"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":39,"end":42},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":39,"end":42},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":39,"end":42},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":39,"end":42},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":147,"end":152},"obj":"P28562"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":274,"end":277},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":274,"end":277},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":274,"end":277},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":274,"end":277},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":278,"end":282},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":316,"end":319},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":316,"end":319},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":316,"end":319},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":316,"end":319},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":419,"end":424},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":554,"end":560},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":604,"end":608},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":703,"end":709},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":812,"end":817},"obj":"P28562"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":967,"end":973},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1021},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1191},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1219,"end":1221},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1254,"end":1256},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1281,"end":1283},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1348,"end":1354},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1411,"end":1417},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1432,"end":1434},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1515,"end":1517},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1530,"end":1536},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1609},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1633,"end":1639},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1758,"end":1760},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1786,"end":1792},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1826,"end":1832},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1928,"end":1934},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":2057,"end":2063},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":2143,"end":2149},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":2260,"end":2263},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":2260,"end":2263},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":2260,"end":2263},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":2260,"end":2263},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":2264,"end":2268},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":2298,"end":2304},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2362,"end":2364},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2382,"end":2388},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2434,"end":2440},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2512,"end":2515},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2512,"end":2515},"obj":"P21579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
