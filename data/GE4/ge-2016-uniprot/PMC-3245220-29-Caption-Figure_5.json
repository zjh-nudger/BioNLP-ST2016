Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (B) MDMs were pretreated with either vehicle or Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes before the addition of M-CSF for 10 minutes. Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 of NF-\u03baB p65 was detected using phospho-specific antibodies to either residue of NF-\u03baB p65. (C) Whole cell lysates of RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle control or Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presence of M-CSF were subjected to Western blot analysis with phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 NF-\u03baB p65 antibodies. (D) Cytosolic and nuclear fractions of RAW 264.7 were obtained from the treated cells and immunoblotted for phospho-NF-\u03baB. The purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting with GAPDH and Lamin B, respectively. Shown are representative blots from three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":2,"end":5},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":45,"end":49},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":105,"end":108},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":105,"end":108},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":235,"end":240},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":237,"end":240},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":342,"end":346},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":512,"end":517},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":514,"end":517},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":625,"end":628},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":625,"end":628},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":703,"end":706},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":703,"end":706},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":823,"end":828},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":825,"end":828},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":913,"end":916},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":913,"end":916},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1144},"obj":"P04406"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
