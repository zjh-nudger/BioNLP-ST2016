Five different Silencer or Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX1 (Applied Biosystems) and three Silencer Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX3 (Applied Biosystems) were tested, and the best was selected for all further experiments. The Silencer Negative Control #1 siRNA (Applied Biosystems) was used for normalization. Cells were then left unstimulated or were stimulated after 12 h with anti-CD2, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28. Cells were cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium with the addition of 1 nmol/l IL-2 (Roche). Cells were harvested for mRNA detection of the target genes after 24 h and for protein detection after 48 h.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":32,"end":35},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":263,"end":268},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":333,"end":338},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":590,"end":593},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":614,"end":618},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":654,"end":657},"obj":"P26358"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":697,"end":701},"obj":"P60568"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
