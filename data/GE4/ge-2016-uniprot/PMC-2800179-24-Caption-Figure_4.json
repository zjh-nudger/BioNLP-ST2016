Antigen expression was then analyzed by flow cytometry. A: Histograms of ICAM-1 expression in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). B: Fluorescence intensity for expression of the antigens HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD14, ICAM-1, and CD58 in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). Data are mean +/\u2212 SEM.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":24,"end":30},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":299,"end":305},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":477,"end":481},"obj":"P08571"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":483,"end":489},"obj":"P05362"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":495,"end":499},"obj":"P19256"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
