At \u223c42 h after the initial TCR activation of 106 CD8+ T cells per well in 12-well plates, the culture media was removed and replaced with complete media supplemented with 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene containing fresh plus concentrated virus. The plates were centrifuged at 700 g for 1 h at RT before returning to 37\u00b0C for an additional 5 h. Retroviral constructs for Eomes-VP16 and the MIG control empty vector were a gift from S.L. Reiner (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (8).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":38},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":35,"end":38},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":271,"end":274},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":271,"end":274},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":578,"end":583},"obj":"O95936"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
