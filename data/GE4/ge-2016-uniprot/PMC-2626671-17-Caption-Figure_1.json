(A) Kinetics of Prf1, Gzmb, Tbx21 (T-bet), and Eomes mRNA expression in differentiating P14 CD8+ T cells analyzed by Northern blotting. RNA from day 7 Th1 cells was used as a control. Sizes of mRNA transcripts are indicated. (B) Quantification of relative mRNA amounts by phosphorimager analysis. (C) Kinetics of protein expression in differentiating P14 CD8+ T cells analyzed by immunoblotting. Sizes of protein bands are indicated. (D) Relative protein amounts quantified from the Western blots. (E) Intracellular staining for granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF. Granzyme B staining was specific relative to an isotype control (not depicted). Cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. (F) FACS-based assay to measure cytolytic activity of P14 CD8+ T cells against EL4 targets loaded with 0 (\u2212) or 1 (+) \u03bcM Gp33 peptide (effector-to-target ratio = 5:1). Percentage of Annexin V+ (apoptotic) target cells in the CD8-negative EL4 target population (dot plots) was determined (histograms). Cytolytic activity was blocked by incubation with 2 mM EGTA (not depicted), confirming involvement of the granule exocytosis (perforin\u2013granzyme B) pathway. Data are representative of at least five (A\u2013E) or three (F) independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":38},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":35,"end":38},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":84},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":86,"end":90},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":92,"end":97},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":99,"end":104},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":311,"end":319},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":419,"end":422},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":419,"end":422},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":502,"end":510},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":593,"end":603},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":605,"end":610},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":616,"end":619},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":621,"end":631},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":654,"end":662},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":815,"end":818},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":815,"end":818},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":939,"end":948},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":982,"end":985},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":982,"end":985},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1184,"end":1192},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1203},"obj":"P10144"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
