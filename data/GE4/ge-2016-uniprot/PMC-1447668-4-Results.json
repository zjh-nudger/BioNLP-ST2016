To address this question, we examined the transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR, which contains two tandem cis-acting NF-\u03baB binding sites located between positions \u2212102 and \u221281 with respect to the transcription initiation site [21]. NF-\u03baB plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression directed from the HIV-1 LTR in CD4+ T cells [21]. Overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not \u0394FKH, in HEK 293T cells was able to inhibit basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR (Figure 3A), similar to what was previously demonstrated with the synthetic NF-\u03baB reporter vector (Figure 2B). Furthermore, HIV-1 LTR activation was suppressed by full-length Foxp3 and \u0394FKH in Jurkat T cells (Figure 3B). To demonstrate that Foxp3-mediated HIV-1 LTR repression was associated with interactions with NF-\u03baB bound to the HIV-1 LTR, we compared basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR or an identical HIV-1 LTR lacking the NF-\u03baB sites located between \u2212102 and \u221281 (HIV-1 \u0394-\u03baB LTR) (Figure 3C). This mutant HIV-1 LTR construct exhibited reduced levels of transcription compared to the parental HIV-1 LTR in purified healthy donor CD4+ T cells (unpublished data). However, directly comparing the effect of Foxp3 overexpression on the activation of these two viral promoters demonstrated that Foxp3 was more capable of suppressing transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR (Figure 3D) compared to the mutated HIV-1 LTR (Figure 3E). These results suggest that Foxp3 down-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activation was mediated at least in part by cis-acting NF-\u03baB binding sites. Residual levels of inhibition of the HIV-1 \u0394-\u03baB LTR by Foxp3 may be due to NF-AT binding sites located upstream of the NF-\u03baB sites within the HIV-1 LTR [22,23].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":87,"end":92},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":180,"end":185},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":633,"end":636},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":682,"end":687},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":697,"end":701},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":725,"end":729},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":950,"end":955},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":960,"end":964},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1021},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1410,"end":1413},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1485,"end":1490},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1576},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1739,"end":1744},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1905,"end":1910},"obj":"Q9BZS1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
