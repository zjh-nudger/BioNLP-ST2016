(A) IFN-\u03b3 expression by WT (Tbx21+/+) and T-bet\u2013deficient (Tbx21\u2212/\u2212) T cells. Naive CD8+ T cells, or cells activated and cultured for 4 or 6 d, were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 6 h, and IFN-\u03b3 expression was assessed by intracellular staining. Numbers show the percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ cells. (B) Northern blot analysis of Prf1 and GzmB mRNA expression in WT or T-bet\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells activated and either left uninfected (uninf) or transduced with retroviruses expressing Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP). Total cellular RNA was analyzed on day 6 of culture. The frequency of transduced cells in the cultures was equivalent for both constructs (\u223c65\u201370% GFP+ cells; not depicted). (C) Granzyme B and IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tbx21+/+ and Tbx21\u2212/\u2212 T cells analyzed in restimulated cells that had been cultured for 5 d. (D) IFN-\u03b3 production by cells transduced with Eo-VP16 or control (GFP) retroviruses (RV) measured on day 4 after 6 h of restimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Numbers show the percentage of GFP+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells. Results are representative of three (A and C) or two (B and D) independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":22},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":24,"end":34},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":40,"end":45},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":60,"end":65},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":70,"end":75},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":105,"end":110},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":129,"end":134},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":143,"end":148},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":160,"end":165},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":185,"end":188},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":185,"end":188},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":299,"end":304},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":387,"end":392},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":431,"end":435},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":440,"end":444},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":470,"end":475},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":486,"end":489},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":486,"end":489},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":587,"end":592},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":599,"end":606},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":625,"end":628},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":639,"end":642},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":792,"end":795},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":823,"end":833},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":838,"end":843},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":858,"end":863},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":871,"end":876},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":955,"end":960},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":997,"end":1004},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1020},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1140,"end":1143},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1145,"end":1150},"obj":"P01579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
