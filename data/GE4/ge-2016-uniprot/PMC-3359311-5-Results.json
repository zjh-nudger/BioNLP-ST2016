To further examine this relationship, PBMCs from CF patients and healthy adult controls were stimulated with PAO1, LPS+ATP, and LPS+Poly(dA:dT), to activate the NLRC4, NLRP3, and AIM2 inflammasomes, respectively. By 24 hours of stimulation, CF PBMCs did not produce increased amounts of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5a) or IL-8 (Fig. 5b) when compared to healthy controls. However, we did notice a transient decrease (P<0.001) in the amount of IL-1\u03b2 produced by CF cells in response to LPS+ATP at 6 hours (data not shown). Stimulation of PBMCs with P. aeruginosa that lacks exsA (PAO1\u0394exsA), a key regulator of type III secretion, produced three-fold less IL-1\u03b2 compared to the parental PAO1 strain by 24 hours (Fig. 5a). Inflammasome stimulation without priming did not result in any IL-1\u03b2 production in either CF or control PBMCs. Contrary to our hypothesis, these results indicate that PBMCs from CF patients do not display increased production of IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 with inflammasome activation nor do they suggest any increased basal or induced NF-\u03baB activity. These results are consistent with our observation that caspase-1 activity is not different between CF and control PBMCs (Fig. 4).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":536,"end":541},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":555,"end":559},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":676,"end":681},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"P26993"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":888,"end":893},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1022},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1188},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":1192,"end":1196},"obj":"P10145"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
