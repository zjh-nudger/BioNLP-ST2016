After ICS FACS, data were collected on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star). For ELISA, cells were similarly restimulated for 48 hr and supernatant was collected and analyzed for IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 as described before (Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":97,"end":100},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":97,"end":100},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":97,"end":100},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":97,"end":100},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":120,"end":124},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":459,"end":463},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":465,"end":470},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":476,"end":481},"obj":"P01579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
