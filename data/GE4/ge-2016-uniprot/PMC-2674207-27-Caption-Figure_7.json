(B) Nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactivity in PBMCs from seven steroid-na\u00efve asthma patients 2 h following inhaled FP treatment (100 or 500 \u00b5g via spacer). The median and interquartile ranges for each treatment are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot (n\u200a=\u200a7); * p<0.05 Wilcoxon's rank test compared with placebo. (C) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression after inhalation of FP. (D) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression 2 h after inhalation of FP. Histone H1 and MEK-1 immunoblotting confirmed equivalent total protein loading for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions respectively. Quantification of the densitometry data in (C) and (D) is shown as a box-and-whiskers plot of results from n\u200a=\u200a6 participants for which data were available. *p<0.05 compared to control. (E) Western blot analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in dual phosphorylation (threonine-180 and tyrosine-182) of p38 MAPK after inhalation of FP (500 \u00b5g). The results shown in (E) are representative of samples from two participants.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":39,"end":45},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":164,"end":166},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":171,"end":177},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":212,"end":218},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":608,"end":614},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":642,"end":648},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":785,"end":791},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":819,"end":825},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":880,"end":885},"obj":"Q02750"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1323},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1323},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1323},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1323},"obj":"O15264"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
