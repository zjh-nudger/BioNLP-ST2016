It follows that HOIP is likely a key mediator of CD40 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated A20.2J and HOIP-deficient cells with CD154 (CD40 ligand) expressed by HI5 insect cells [7], [8] and measured activation of the NF-\u03baB and JNK pathways, two of the major transcriptional regulators activated by CD40 [4]. Cell-associated CD154 was used as the stimulus in these experiments as it typically provides more robust, and therefore more readily detected, activation signals than does anti-CD40 antibody. Activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway is initiated with the phosphorylation of I\u03baB proteins by the I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK). In resting cells, I\u03baB proteins are responsible for sequestering NF-\u03baB subunits in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation by the IKK complex targets I\u03baB proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, allowing NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus and activate gene expression. CD40-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in HOIP-deficient cells was dramatically impaired relative to that observed in parental A20.2J cells (Fig. 4). We also assayed activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK in response to CD40 engagement (Fig. 4). CD40-mediated JNK activation in HOIP-deficient cells was impaired as measured by phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 in JNK. CD40-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK in HOIP-reconstituted cells was normal, demonstrating that the defects observed in gene-deficient cells were due to the absence of HOIP expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":93,"end":97},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":125,"end":129},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":186,"end":190},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":219,"end":223},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":274,"end":277},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":285,"end":289},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":311,"end":316},"obj":"P29965"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":318,"end":322},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":318,"end":329},"obj":"P29965"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":482,"end":486},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":508,"end":513},"obj":"P29965"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":669,"end":673},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":787,"end":797},"obj":"O15111"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":787,"end":797},"obj":"Q60680-2"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1072},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1121},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1129},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1172,"end":1180},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1210,"end":1213},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1267,"end":1298},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1267,"end":1298},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1267,"end":1302},"obj":"P53779"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1322},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1344,"end":1348},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1376,"end":1380},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1470,"end":1474},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1514,"end":1518},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1642,"end":1646},"obj":"Q96EP0"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
