Ramos cells, which have been described to express BMP-6 mRNA endogenously [20], and the T cell line Jurkat, served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Endogenous BMP-6 mRNA levels in normal B cells were quantified by real-time RT-PCR after stimulation with anti-IgM for different time points. Interestingly, the up-regulation of BMP-6 mRNA was characteristic of an early-to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti-IgM. The level of BMP-6 mRNA was back to baseline after 24 hours upon stimulation (Figure 10). Furthermore, both FCS and human AB-serum induced significant upregulation of BMP-6 mRNA (Figure 11). Interestingly, in a separate study we have found that normal human T cells do not express BMP-6 mRNA after activation (Sivertsen et al, manuscript in preparation). Next, we wanted to detect BMP-6 protein in normal B-cells and tested various commercially available antibodies. However, in our hands these anti-BMP-6 antibodies did only recognize the recombinant BMP-6 protein and not the native protein.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":42,"end":45},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":42,"end":45},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":42,"end":45},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":42,"end":45},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":42,"end":47},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":209,"end":214},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":283,"end":286},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":283,"end":286},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":283,"end":288},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":283,"end":286},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":283,"end":286},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":408,"end":413},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":575,"end":578},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":575,"end":578},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":575,"end":580},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":575,"end":578},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":575,"end":578},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":730,"end":735},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":730,"end":733},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":730,"end":733},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":730,"end":733},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":730,"end":733},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":884,"end":887},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":884,"end":887},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":884,"end":887},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":884,"end":887},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":884,"end":889},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":998,"end":1003},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1101},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1101},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1101},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1101},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1220},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1220},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1220},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1220},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1222},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1272},"obj":"P12644"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1272},"obj":"P22004"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1272},"obj":"P18075"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1272},"obj":"P12643"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1274},"obj":"P22004"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
