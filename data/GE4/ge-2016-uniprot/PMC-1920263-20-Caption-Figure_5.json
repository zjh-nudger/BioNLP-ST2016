(A) A3.01\u2009T cells were transfected with reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic containing 180, 150 or 120\u2009bp of the A3G promoter. The two G-to-T substitutions introduced into the GC-box of the 180\u2009bp fragment (180mut) are specified. After 48\u2009h, cells were harvested for luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities. Mean values (\u00b1SD) of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown. (B) pGL3-Promoter reporter plasmids containing the regions E1 or E2 (see Figure 1) upstream of the SV40 promoter were transfected into A3.01\u2009T cells. Firefly luciferase activities after 48\u2009h were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities. Mean values (\u00b1SD) of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":177,"end":180},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":331,"end":341},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":357,"end":367},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":418,"end":428},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":683,"end":693},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":755,"end":765},"obj":"P08659"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
