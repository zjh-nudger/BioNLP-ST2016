Briefly, cells were resuspended in ice-cold Buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.4 % NP-40, 0.5 mM PMSF, complete protease inhibitor cocktail) at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C, 500 \u00d7 g for 3 min, and supernatants were collected as cytosolic fractions. Pellets were incubated in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, complete protease inhibitor cocktail) at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected as nuclear fractions following a centrifuge at 4 \u00b0C, 13,800 \u00d7 g for 10 min.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":189,"end":191},"obj":"P0A7Z4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
