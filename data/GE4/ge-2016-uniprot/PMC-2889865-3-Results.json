The cytokine profile revealed an enhanced induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-6, TNF and the chemokine CXCL8. The levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were unaffected by PMA but were significantly decreased by HK E. coli (Table 1). These results confirmed that PMA and HK E. coli induced an inflammatory response in the Jurkat T-cells. It is interesting to note that PMA was 120-fold more effective at inducing CXCL8 than HK E. coli. PMA-dependent induction of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-\u03baB suggests an involvement of AP-1 in CXCL8 regulation. Determination of the time course of cytokine induction in response to PMA showed that CXCL8 was already released between 2-6 h, while TNF and IL-6 were released between 6-24 h (figure 3). These results indicated that the cytokines were differentially regulated and that the release was not associated with the early transient induction of NF-\u03baB. The temporal induction of AP-1 correlated to the CXCL8 levels and preceded the TNF and IL-6 release. This suggests an association between CXCL8 release and AP-1 signalling.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":284,"end":288},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":296,"end":299},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":370,"end":375},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":636,"end":641},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":686,"end":690},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":747,"end":751},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":755,"end":760},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":859,"end":864},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":907,"end":910},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":915,"end":919},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1145,"end":1149},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1168,"end":1173},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1198,"end":1201},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1210},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1262},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1275,"end":1279},"obj":"P05412"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
