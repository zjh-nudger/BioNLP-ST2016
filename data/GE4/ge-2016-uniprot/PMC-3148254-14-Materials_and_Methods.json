Briefly, 3\u00d7107 cells (A20.2J and derivatives) were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature with 10 \u00b5l magnetic protein G beads (Dynal) pre-coated with 10 \u00b5g goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson), and 10 \u00b5g anti-CD40 (1C10) or an isotype control antibody (mAb72). Cells/beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X100. Beads were washed with lysis buffer to remove unbound material. In some experiments, material associated with the beads was dephosphorylated with lambda phosphatase (New England BioLabs) as per manufacturer's instructions. Beads were resuspended in 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C. Material eluted from the beads was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for Western blotting. In some experiments, cells were cultured for 6 hrs with 25 \u00b5M antennapedia-linked SMAC-N7 peptide (Calbiochem) or an appropriate volume of the solvent used for the peptide (DMSO). After incubation, cells (in peptide- or DMSO-containing medium) were stimulated with antibody-coated beads as outlined above.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":48},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":145,"end":148},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":329,"end":333},"obj":"P25942"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
