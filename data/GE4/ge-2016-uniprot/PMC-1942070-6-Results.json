Initial experiments revealed that surface expression of the BCR was reduced in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 (and in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212:Flag-PKD3+ve) cells compared to wild-type DT40 B cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Nevertheless, BCR-crosslinking of PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 cells was sufficient to induce the activation of a number of signalling cascades, similar to that observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B). Hence, BCR-induced activation of the Akt, mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (as shown by S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation) and MAPK signalling pathways was clearly detectable in PKD1/3-null B cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins as well as an increase in intracellular calcium levels was also observed following BCR stimulation of PKD1/3-null B cells (data not shown). We did observe that the strength of BCR (but not phorbol ester)-induced regulation of the Erk1-RSK1 signalling pathway was reduced in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 B cells compared to wild-type B cells (Fig. 3B). One interpretation of this data is that PKD enzymes may modulate Erk activation. Indeed, PKD enzymes have previously been linked to the growth factor-regulated Erk signalling in fibroblast and endothelial cell lines [33\u201335]. However, BCR-induced Erk phosphorylation was also reduced in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212-Flag-PKD3+ B cells (data not shown) suggesting that reduced BCR levels on the surface of PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 (and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212-Flag-PKD3+) B cells may itself impact on the strength of activation of this specific intracellular signalling pathway.\nTo search for other potential PKD targets that may show defective regulation in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells, we used a PKD substrate phospho-antibody that recognises consensus phosphorylation sequences targeted by PKD enzymes (LxRxxpS/T) [36]. As shown in Fig. 3C, phorbol ester- and BCR-induced phosphorylation of cellular substrates detected by this phospho-antibody was similar in wild-type and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 cells and is therefore independent of PKD enzymes. However, pretreatment of both wild-type and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells with GF109203X, a bisindoylmaleimide derivative that inhibits PKCs prevented the induction of proteins that contain phosphorylated LxRxxS/T motifs. Thus loss of PKD1/3 enzymes does not globally disrupt the phosphorylation of cellular proteins that contain LxRxxpS/T motifs. This result is perhaps not surprising as LxRxxS/T motifs also act as good substrates for other serine/threonine kinases such as MAPKAPK2. However these experiments do provide further evidence that phosphospecific antisera are not sufficiently selective to be designated kinase specific substrate antisera.\nBCR-induced signalling pathways culminate in the activation of gene transcription events that control B cell survival, proliferation and function. In this context, it has been proposed that PKD family members control of gene transcription through activation of the NF\u03baB transcription factor. Thus, PKD-mediated activation of NF\u03baB occurs downstream of a variety of different signals, including mROS/oxidative stress, lysophosphatidic acid and the Bcr-Abl oncogene [17,21,23,30,37]. Furthermore, expression of an activated PKD1 mutant enhances HPK1-mediated NF\u03baB activation [38]. In B cells, NF\u03baB is known to be regulated via DAG and PKC\u03b2 [39,40] but whether PKDs are key intermediaries for NF\u03baB regulation has not been explored.\nThe data (Fig. 4A) show that NF\u03baB transcriptional activity was strongly induced in both wild-type and PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells in response to either phorbol ester or BCR stimulation. In contrast, BCR and phorbol ester-induced NF\u03baB transcriptional activity was abolished in PKC\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 DT40 B cells (Fig. 4A), although strong activation of PKD kinases (as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 at S916) was observed in the PKC\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, PKD kinases are neither essential nor sufficient to mediate BCR-induced NF\u03baB activation in DT40 B cells and hence do not participate in DAG/PKC mediated control of NF\u03baB.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":182,"end":185},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":314,"end":317},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":333,"end":337},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":351,"end":355},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":366,"end":370},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":460,"end":463},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":480,"end":484},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":634,"end":637},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":664,"end":667},"obj":"P31751"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":664,"end":667},"obj":"P31749"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":664,"end":667},"obj":"Q9Y243"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":669,"end":673},"obj":"P42345"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":794,"end":798},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":985,"end":988},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1008},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1078,"end":1081},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1136},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1180},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1469,"end":1472},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1525},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1536,"end":1540},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1591,"end":1594},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1620,"end":1624},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1635,"end":1639},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1650,"end":1654},"obj":"Q99853"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1844,"end":1848},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":2043,"end":2046},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":2157,"end":2161},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":2262,"end":2266},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":2446,"end":2450},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":2865,"end":2868},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":3311,"end":3314},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":3315,"end":3318},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":3386,"end":3390},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":3695,"end":3699},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":3757,"end":3760},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":3787,"end":3790},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":3977,"end":3981},"obj":"P98161"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":4102,"end":4105},"obj":"P11274"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
