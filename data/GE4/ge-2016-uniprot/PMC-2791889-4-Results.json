T\u00a0cells were recovered from the inguinal lymph nodes 3 days after priming and restimulated in\u00a0vitro with OVA peptide for 48 hr. This in\u00a0vivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (Figure\u00a03A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 \u03bcM versus 1 \u03bcM, data not shown). To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in\u00a0vivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before. In vivo expression of both IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 was markedly reduced but not completely abrogated in the absence of STAT4 signaling (Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that were absent in the in\u00a0vitro system. Signaling through STAT6 had no effect on IL-10 production by Th1 cells as shown by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and by immunoassay in STAT6-deficient T\u00a0cells (Figures 3B and 3C).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":28},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":72,"end":77},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":135,"end":140},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":283,"end":286},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":447,"end":450},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":504,"end":509},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":514,"end":519},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":550,"end":555},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":656,"end":659},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":716,"end":721},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":726,"end":731},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":772,"end":777},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":814,"end":819},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":824,"end":829},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":906,"end":909},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":965,"end":970},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":975,"end":980},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1049,"end":1054},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1197,"end":1202},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1225},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1322,"end":1327},"obj":"P42226"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
