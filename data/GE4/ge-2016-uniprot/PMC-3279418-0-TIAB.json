The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this inflammatory phenotype remain elusive. Dendritic cells may contribute to the initiation and progression of the phenotype of SHARPIN-deficient mice because of their pivotal role in innate and adaptive immunity. Here we show by flow cytometry that SHARPIN- deficiency did not alter the distribution of different DC subtypes in the spleen. In response to TOLL-like receptor (TLR) agonists LPS and poly I:C, cultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from WT and mutant mice exhibited similar increases in expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. However, stimulated SHARPIN-deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide. Mutant BMDC had defective activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, whereas the MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK11/12/13/14 (p38 MAP kinase isoforms) and TBK1 signaling pathways were intact. A mixed lymphocyte reaction showed that mutant BMDC only induced a weak Th1 immune response but stimulated increased Th2 cytokine production from allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, loss of Sharpin in mice significantly affects the immune function of DC and this may partially account for the systemic inflammation and Th2-biased immune response.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"Q9H0F6"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":148,"end":155},"obj":"Q9H0F6"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":228,"end":233},"obj":"Q9H0F6"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":581,"end":588},"obj":"Q9H0F6"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":703,"end":710},"obj":"Q9H0F6"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1011},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1017},"obj":"P33681"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1027},"obj":"P42081"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":1049,"end":1056},"obj":"Q9H0F6"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1145},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1161},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1255},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1263},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1271,"end":1277},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1288,"end":1291},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1288,"end":1291},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1288,"end":1291},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1288,"end":1291},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1321},"obj":"Q9UHD2"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1517,"end":1520},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1554,"end":1561},"obj":"Q9H0F6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
