NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity was analyzed by EMSA Shown is a representative blot from three independent experiments. NS: non-stimulated. (B) Human MDMs transiently transfected with pTAL-SEAP or pNF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs were treated with M-CSF in X-vivo medium and incubated for 6 hours before the collection of medium. NF-\u03baB activity was analyzed by measuring the amount of SEAP secreted into the medium and data are expressed as fold increase of SEAP activity over that in pTAL-SEAP transfected resting cells. (C) RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with pTAL-SEAP or pNF-\u03baB-SEAP construct. Cells were serum starved for 4 hours prior to 2 hours stimulation with mouse recombinant M-CSF (100 ng/ml). Culture media was collected to measure SEAP production. Data are expressed mean \u00b1 S.E.M, for three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":2,"end":5},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":127,"end":132},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":129,"end":132},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":388,"end":393},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":390,"end":393},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":841,"end":846},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":843,"end":846},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
