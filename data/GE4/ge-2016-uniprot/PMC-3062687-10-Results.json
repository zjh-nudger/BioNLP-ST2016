To explore the mechanism by which NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, we first performed an in vitro kinase assay with purified wild-type His-NleH1 protein and a mutant His-NleH1 (K159A) protein, confirming that NleH1 is autophosphorylated and the K159A is an NleH1 kinase-dead mutant (Fig. 7a). To examine whether the kinase activity is required for NleH1 to inhibit IKK\u03b2 phosphorlyation of RPS3 on S209, we ectopically expressing either wild-type or K159A NleH1 in 293T cells. Wild-type NleH1 expression significantly reduced TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, whereas the K159A mutant failed to do so (Fig. 7b). Thus NleH1 kinase activity is required to protect RPS3 from IKK\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation.\nCitrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen that shares pathogenic strategies with E. coli 39, most notably for our investigation, C. rodentium NleH inhibited RPS3 nuclear translocation and RPS3-dependent NF-\u03baB luciferase activity to an extent equivalent to E. coli NleH1 (ref. 9). We assayed RPS3 S209 phosphorylation in HeLa cells infected with different C. rodentium strains. In uninfected cells, TNF-treatment stimulated a \u223c3.5-fold increase in RPS3 S209 phosphorylation (Fig. 7c). Such augmentation of RPS3 phosphorylation was reduced by about 60% by wild-type C. rodentium infection (Fig. 7c). However, RPS3 phosphorylation was enhanced when cells were infected with a C. rodentium strain lacking NleH (Fig. 7c, \u0394nleH). We further examined the role of NleH1 kinase activity using the C. rodentium \u0394nleH strain as a background on which to express either wild-type or K159A E. coli NleH1. Complementing \u0394nleH mutant with wild-type NleH1 almost abolished TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation whereas complementing with K159A failed to inhibit RPS3 phosphorylation (Fig. 7c). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NleH1 kinase activity is required to block RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.\nWe next examined whether the inhibitory activity of NleH1 is sufficiently robust to impair the strong nuclear translocation of RPS3 trigged by the constitutively-active IKK\u03b2 (IKK\u03b2 [SSEE]) (Fig. 2d). We found that ectopically expressing either wild-type or SSEE IKK\u03b2 proteins, triggered more RPS3 nuclear translocation than the kinase-dead IKK\u03b2 (SSAA) protein (Fig. 7d). RPS3 nuclear accumulation was substantially retarded by infecting cells with wild-type E. coli O157:H7 (Fig. 7d). In contrast, infecting with either \u0394nleH1 or \u0394escN strains only slightly impaired RPS3 nuclear translocation in either IKK\u03b2- or IKK\u03b2 (SSEE)-expressing cells (Fig. 7d). As expected, E. coli infections did not affect the RPS3 nuclear translocation in IKK\u03b2 (SSAA)-expressing cells, where NF-\u03baB signaling was low (Fig. 7d). Thus, during infection NleH1 is sufficiently potent to inhibit RPS3 nuclear translocation even in cells expressing constitutively-activated IKK\u03b2.\nWe examined whether NleH1 could directly phosphorylate IKK\u03b2 thus inhibiting IKK\u03b2-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation. We performed in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Flag-IKK\u03b2 (K44A) as substrate and recombinant His-NleH1 as kinase, so that IKK\u03b2 autophosphorylation would not obscure NleH1-induced phosphorylation. However, we did not observe any detectable 32P incorporation in IKK\u03b2 (Supplementary Fig. 13), thus ruling out this possibility.\nWe then tested the hypothesis that NleH1 could alter the IKK\u03b2 substrate specificities. To this end, we performed in vitro kinase assays using both CK2 and IKK substrates for IKK\u03b2. As expected, IKK\u03b2 phosphorylated RPS3 (Fig. 7e, lane 7) and GST-I\u03baB\u03b1 (1-54) protein (Fig. 7e, lane 9), demonstrating it harbors either CK2 or IKK substrate specificity. Preincubation of IKK\u03b2 with NleH1 reduced IKK\u03b2-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation, i.e. the CK2 kinase specificity, but not IKK\u03b2-mediated GST-I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, i.e. the IKK kinase specificity (Fig. 7e). Control experiments revealed no NleH1-mediated phosphorylation or autophosphorylation of RPS3 or GST-I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig. 7e). Taken together, NleH1 blocks the CK2 substrate specificity of IKK\u03b2 thus inhibiting the IKK\u03b2-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation thus representing a novel strategy by E. coli O157:H7 to alter the host innate immune response.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":21},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":46,"end":51},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":177,"end":182},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":192,"end":196},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":291,"end":296},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":322,"end":327},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":361,"end":366},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":500,"end":505},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":517,"end":521},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":541,"end":545},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":607,"end":612},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":638,"end":643},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":677,"end":680},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":689,"end":693},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":773,"end":778},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":818,"end":822},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":828,"end":832},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1020},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1051},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1078},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1123,"end":1128},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1154},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1260},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1306,"end":1310},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1368},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1466,"end":1470},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1615,"end":1620},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1743,"end":1748},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1792,"end":1797},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1818},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1827,"end":1831},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1904,"end":1908},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1981,"end":1986},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":2024,"end":2028},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":2103,"end":2108},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":2178,"end":2182},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":2220,"end":2224},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":2226,"end":2230},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":2312,"end":2316},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":2342,"end":2346},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":2390,"end":2394},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":2421,"end":2425},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":2570,"end":2576},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":2580,"end":2585},"obj":"Q7DB71"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":2617,"end":2621},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":2654,"end":2658},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":2663,"end":2667},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2754,"end":2758},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2784,"end":2788},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2878,"end":2883},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2918,"end":2922},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2995,"end":2999},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":3021,"end":3026},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":3056,"end":3060},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":3077,"end":3081},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":3091,"end":3095},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":3184,"end":3188},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":3229,"end":3234},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":3254,"end":3258},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":3297,"end":3302},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":3392,"end":3396},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":3491,"end":3496},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":3513,"end":3517},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":3630,"end":3634},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":3649,"end":3653},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":3669,"end":3673},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":3700,"end":3704},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":3822,"end":3826},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":3832,"end":3837},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":3846,"end":3850},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":3860,"end":3864},"obj":"P23396"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":3923,"end":3927},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":3941,"end":3945},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin":4038,"en
