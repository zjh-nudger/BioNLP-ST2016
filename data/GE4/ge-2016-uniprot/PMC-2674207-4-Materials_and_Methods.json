PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (density, 1.077 g/ml; Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) as previously described [34]. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 (1 \u00b5g/ml each) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to stimulate Th2 cytokine release in the presence or absence of FP (10\u221212 to 10\u22128M). Cytospins were prepared and GATA-3 localization determined by confocal microscopy as previously described [12].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":368,"end":371},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":368,"end":371},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":368,"end":371},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":368,"end":371},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":372,"end":376},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":521,"end":527},"obj":"P23771"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
