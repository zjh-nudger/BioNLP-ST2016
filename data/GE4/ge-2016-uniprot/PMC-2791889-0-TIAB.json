However, the signals that direct the development of IL-10-producing T helper 1 (Th1) cells are undefined. We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation. Repeated TCR triggering led to enhanced IL-10 production by Th1 cells, and continued IL-12 action and high-dose TCR signaling were required for the development and maintenance of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Although Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation, activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was\u00a0a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets. IL-10 expression also correlated with c-maf expression. Despite having distinct functions in protection against pathogens, all Th cells share the important task of controlling overexuberant immune responses by means of IL-10 production.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":14},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":71,"end":76},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":157,"end":160},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":180,"end":194},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":196,"end":201},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":207,"end":219},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":221,"end":226},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":316,"end":321},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":400,"end":405},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":482,"end":486},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":491,"end":495},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":529,"end":534},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":529,"end":534},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":543,"end":548},"obj":"Q14765"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":622,"end":627},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":667,"end":672},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":667,"end":672},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":761,"end":766},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":904,"end":908},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":913,"end":917},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":961,"end":966},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":991,"end":996},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1029,"end":1034},"obj":"O75444"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1031,"end":1034},"obj":"O75444"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1210,"end":1215},"obj":"P22301"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
