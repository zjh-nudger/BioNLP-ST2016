Site-directed mutagenesis for the three putative RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter region was introduced using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by sequencing the DNA. The following primers and their complementary strands were used: foxp runx-333, forward 5\u2032-CACTTTTGTTTTAAAAACTGTCCTTTCTCATGAGCCCTATTATC-3\u2032; foxp runx-333 reverse 5\u2032-GATAATAGGGCTCATGAGAAAGGACAGTTTTTAAAACAAAAGTG-3\u2032; foxp runx-287 forward 5\u2032-CCTCTCACCTCTGTCCTGAGGGGAAGAAATC-3\u2032; foxp runx-287 reverse 5\u2032-GATTTCTTCCCCTCAGGACAGAGGTGAGAGG-3\u2032; foxp runx-53 forward 5\u2032-GCTTCCACACCGTACAGCGTCCTTTTTCTTCTCGGTATAAAAG-3\u2032; foxp runx-53 reverse 5\u2032-CTTTTATACCGAGAAGAAAAAGGACGCTGTACGGTGTGGAAGC-3\u2032.\nThe human RUNX1 fragment from the Addgene plasmid 12504 (Biggs et al., 2006) pFlagCMV2-AML1B was sub-cloned in the pEGFPN1 vector (Clontech Laboratories). The RUNX3 vector pCMV human RUNX3, which was a gift from K. Ito (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Proteos, Singapore) was subcloned into pEGFPN1 vector (Clontech Laboratories; Yamamura et al., 2006).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":15,"end":20},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":54,"end":59},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":74,"end":78},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":74,"end":78},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":74,"end":78},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":104,"end":109},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":192,"end":197},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":280,"end":284},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":280,"end":284},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":280,"end":284},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":306,"end":311},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":535,"end":539},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":535,"end":539},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":535,"end":539},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":610,"end":614},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":610,"end":614},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":610,"end":614},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":684,"end":688},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":684,"end":688},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":684,"end":688},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":745,"end":749},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":745,"end":749},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":745,"end":749},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":878,"end":882},"obj":"Q13950"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":878,"end":882},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":878,"end":882},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":955,"end":960},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1109},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1133},"obj":"Q13761"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
