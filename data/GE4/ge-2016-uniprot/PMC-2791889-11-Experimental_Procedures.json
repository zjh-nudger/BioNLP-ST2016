In most cases, experiments were reproduced with each type of purified CD4+ T\u00a0cell population with similar results obtained. Splenic DCs were prepared as described (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), and sort purified CD11c+ cells were added to the T\u00a0cell culture. Purified DO11.10 CD4+ T\u00a0cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/ml) were cultured as before (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), in a total volume of 1 ml cRPMI medium in a 48-well plate, with splenic DCs (2 \u00d7 104 cells/ml), and varying amounts of OVA and of IL-12. APC-independent differentiation of naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells into Th1 and Th2 cells used stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and appropriate cytokine conditions, and control Th1 and Th2 cells were cultured as described before (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006). Culture conditions for Th17 cells were as described before (Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2006). Importantly, Th1 and Th2 cells could be differentiated in cRPMI or IMDM (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006; Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2006), but Th17 cells were only differentiated optimally in IMDM (Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2009). When indicated, U0126 or PD184352 (MEK inhibitors), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), CT99021 (GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor), or a similar amount of DMSO were present in the culture. More details of specific culture conditions are provided in Figures S6 and S7.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":122,"end":125},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":135,"end":138},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":343,"end":346},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":477,"end":482},"obj":"P20702"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":541,"end":544},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":739,"end":742},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":750,"end":755},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":750,"end":755},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":798,"end":801},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":861,"end":864},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":861,"end":864},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":861,"end":864},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":861,"end":864},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":874,"end":878},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1401},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1401},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1401},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1401},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1423,"end":1428},"obj":"P49841"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
