(A) RUNX1, RUNX3, and FOXP3 mRNA induction in human naive CD4+ T cells after alone or combined anti-CD2/3/28 mAb and TGF-\u03b2 stimulation in the presence of IL-2. Real-time PCR of human naive CD4+ T cells after 48 h of culture. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SE of three independent experiments. (B) FOXP3 mRNA induction by anti-CD2/3/28 mAb and TGF-\u03b2 in human naive CD4+ T cells is reduced after siRNA-mediated RUNX1/3 knockdown. Real-time PCR of RNA from human naive CD4+ T cells, transfected with RUNX1 and/or RUNX3 siRNA or with a control siRNA and cultured with anti-CD2/3/28, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (C) FOXP3 mRNA is down-regulated in iT reg cells after siRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 and RUNX3. Real-time PCR for FOXP3, T-bet, GATA3, and RORC2 from human naive CD4+ T cells, transfected with RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA or with scrambled siRNA (control) and cultured under iT reg, Th1, Th2, or Th17-driving conditions for 12 d. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (D) FOXP3 protein induction in iT reg cells is reduced after siRNA-mediated RUNX1/3 knockdown. Human naive CD4+ T cells were transfected with RUNX1 and/or RUNX3 siRNA or with a control siRNA and stimulated with anti-CD2/3/28 and TGF-\u03b2 in the presence of IL-2. CD4 and intracellular FOXP3 analysis by flow cytometry after 72 h. One of three independent experiments is shown. Statistical differences were verified by the paired Student's t test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":49,"end":54},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":76,"end":81},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":94,"end":99},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":172,"end":175},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":189,"end":194},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":226,"end":230},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":261,"end":264},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":359,"end":364},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":388,"end":391},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":405,"end":410},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":426,"end":429},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":471,"end":476},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":559,"end":564},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":572,"end":577},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":631,"end":634},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":641,"end":646},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":651,"end":655},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":719,"end":724},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":798,"end":803},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":808,"end":813},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":833,"end":838},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":840,"end":845},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":847,"end":852},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":858,"end":863},"obj":"P51449"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":881,"end":884},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":912,"end":917},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":922,"end":927},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1109},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1181},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1210},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1242,"end":1247},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1255,"end":1260},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1319},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1329,"end":1334},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1354,"end":1358},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1360,"end":1363},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1382,"end":1387},"obj":"Q9BZS1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
