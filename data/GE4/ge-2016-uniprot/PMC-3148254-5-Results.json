Previously, we demonstrated that HOIP is recruited to the CD40 signaling complex in a TRAF2-dependent manner, suggesting that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 [6]. Studies by others suggest that the TRAF2-associated proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 play a role in the recruitment of HOIP to TNFR1 and CD40 [14]. Therefore, we determined whether the association of HOIP with CD40 in A20.2J cells was altered by treatment of cells with an inhibitor of cIAP activity, a membrane-permeable peptide derived from the apoptosis regulator SMAC [15]. We found that pretreatment of cells with the SMAC peptide dramatically reduced the amount of cIAP1 associated with the CD40 signaling complex in cells stimulated with anti-CD40 antibody-coated beads (Fig. 5A). SMAC peptide treatment also resulted in a slight but reproducible decrease in the amount of the major HOIP form recovered by CD40 immunoprecipitation, along with an apparent increase in higher molecular weight species recognized by anti-HOIP antibody. In contrast, treatment with the SMAC peptide did not alter the amount or molecular weight of HOIP present in cell lysates. These data suggest that SMAC peptide treatment specifically alters the characteristics of CD40-associated HOIP rather than the entire cellular pool of this protein. Together, these results support the idea that the cIAP proteins influence the recruitment and post-translational modification state of CD40-associated HOIP.\nTo test the possibility that HOIP is responsible for the recruitment of other critical signaling proteins to CD40, we immunoprecipitated CD40 signaling complexes from HOIP-deficient and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig. 5B). As described previously, CD40 signaling complexes immunoprecipitated from A20.2J cells contained HOIP as well as TRAF2, TRAF3, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, and IKK\u03b3 [6]. The amounts of TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1 in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-deficient cells were similar to those from parental A20.2J cells, indicating that HOIP is not required for the association of these proteins with CD40. In contrast, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3 were not detectable in CD40 immunoprecipitates recovered from HOIP-deficient cells (Fig. 5B,C). The amounts of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3 in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-reconstituted cells were similar to those detected in samples prepared from parental cells, demonstrating that the defects in IKK recruitment we observed were due specifically to the absence of HOIP expression. These data indicate that HOIP is required for recruitment of the NF-\u03baB-activating complex to the CD40 signaling complex.\nAs shown here and in our previous study [6], IKK\u03b3 present in CD40 immunoprecipitates appears to have a higher molecular weight than that found in cell lysates. To confirm that this higher molecular weight species was indeed IKK\u03b3, we generated A20.2J cell lines containing a stably integrated retroviral vector that encoded an epitope-tagged version of mouse IKK\u03b3. Cell lysates and CD40 immunoprecipitates prepared from these cells were analyzed by Western blotting for the epitope tag (Fig. 5C). This analysis produced a pattern of bands that was essentially the same as that obtained using an antibody specific for native IKK\u03b3 (compare panels B and C in Fig. 5). Moreover, analysis of cells expressing epitope tagged-IKK\u03b3 confirmed that recruitment of IKK\u03b3 to CD40 requires HOIP. To determine what was responsible for the increased molecular weight of IKK\u03b3 in CD40 immunoprecipitates, the protein samples were incubated with lambda phosphatase, which removes phosphates attached to tyrosine, threonine, or serine residues in proteins. This treatment reduced much of CD40-associated IKK\u03b3 to an apparent molecular weight similar to that of the protein in cell lysates (Fig. 5C). However, at least one band of significantly higher molecular weight remained after phosphatase treatment, suggesting that CD40-associated IKK\u03b3 is subject to at least one other modification in addition to phosphorylation. Overall, these data demonstrate that HOIP is required for the association of IKK\u03b3 with CD40, and suggest that this event is coupled to post-translational modifications of IKK\u03b3.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":58,"end":62},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":85,"end":89},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":142,"end":146},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":178,"end":182},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":234,"end":238},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":309,"end":313},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":334,"end":338},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":362,"end":367},"obj":"Q12933"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":402,"end":406},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":431,"end":436},"obj":"Q12933"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":477,"end":482},"obj":"Q12933"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":503,"end":508},"obj":"Q13490"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":553,"end":557},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":571,"end":575},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":634,"end":638},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":644,"end":648},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":652,"end":655},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":905,"end":910},"obj":"Q13490"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":931,"end":935},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":984,"end":988},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1128},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1147,"end":1151},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1263},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1367,"end":1371},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1487,"end":1491},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1507},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1697,"end":1701},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1713,"end":1717},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1748,"end":1752},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1828,"end":1832},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1856,"end":1860},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1886,"end":1890},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1905,"end":1909},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1966,"end":1970},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":2015,"end":2018},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":2038,"end":2042},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":2054,"end":2059},"obj":"Q12933"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":2061,"end":2066},"obj":"Q13114"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":2105,"end":2110},"obj":"Q12933"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":2112,"end":2117},"obj":"Q13114"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":2123,"end":2128},"obj":"Q13490"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":2132,"end":2136},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":2161,"end":2165},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":2218,"end":2221},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":2248,"end":2252},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":2312,"end":2316},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":2370,"end":2374},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":2409,"end":2413},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2477,"end":2481},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2506,"end":2510},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2705,"end":2709},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2747,"end":2751},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2819,"end":2823},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":2904,"end":2908},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":3086,"end":3089},"obj":"P21580"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":3224,"end":3228},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":3604,"end":3608},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":3618,"end":3622},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":3704,"end":3708},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":3910,"end":3914},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":4143,"end":4147},"obj":"P25942"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":4279,"end":4283},"obj":"Q96EP0"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":4329,"end":4333},"obj":"P25942"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
