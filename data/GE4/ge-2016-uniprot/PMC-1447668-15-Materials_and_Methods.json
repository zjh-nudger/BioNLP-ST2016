Briefly, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) according to manufacturer's guidelines, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using TaqMan Gold RT-PCR Kit using random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States). Foxp3 and HTLV-I Tax mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR using ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The normalized values in each sample were calculated as the relative quantity of Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax mRNA expression divided by the relative quantity of HPRT mRNA expression. The values were calculated by the following formula: normalized Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax expression = 2Ct value of HPRT \u2013 Ct value of Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":20},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":91,"end":96},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":108,"end":111},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":484,"end":489},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":501,"end":504},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":682,"end":690},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":703,"end":708},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":719,"end":722},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":754,"end":762},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":861,"end":866},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":877,"end":880},"obj":"P03409"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":926,"end":931},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":942,"end":945},"obj":"P03409"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
