(B) GR isolated from FP (10\u22128 M) stimulated cells enhances GR\u2013importin-\u03b1 binding in the presence (\u2022) and absence (\u25aa) of activated GATA-3. * p<0.05 compared to no activated GR. (C) GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated cells does not attenuate GR\u2013importin-\u03b1 association. *p<0.05 compared to control. (D) Activated GR blocks the ability of purified phospho-GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated cells interacting with immobilised importin-\u03b1 in an in vitro binding assay. *p<0.05 compared to GATA-3 isolated from unstimulated cells. #p<0.05 compared to stimulated GATA-3-importin binding. (E) The effect of activated (\u2022) versus unstimulated (\u25cb) GR on attenuation of GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association was concentration-dependent. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 between groups. All results are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM of three independent experiments and analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":45,"end":51},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":144,"end":146},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":199,"end":201},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":270,"end":276},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":312,"end":314},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":320,"end":326},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":346,"end":349},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":346,"end":349},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":346,"end":349},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":346,"end":349},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":350,"end":354},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":391,"end":393},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":461,"end":463},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":503,"end":509},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":529,"end":532},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":529,"end":532},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":529,"end":532},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":529,"end":532},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":533,"end":537},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":645,"end":651},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":717,"end":723},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":798,"end":800},"obj":"P04150"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":819,"end":825},"obj":"P23771"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
