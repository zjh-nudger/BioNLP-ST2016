Normal littermate controls were either +/+ or +/Sharpincpdm. These control animals were phenotypically indistinguishable and are referred to as WT. Sex-matched WT and mutant mice were used at 6\u201310 weeks of age. For some experiments, cpdm mice were crossed with transgenic mice with a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the Sharpin gene (FVB/NJ-Tg(RP24-173I23)1Sun/Sun, JR#8279). These mice were backcrossed onto the C57BL/KaLawRij-Sharpincpdm/RijSunJ background and N4 mice were used in the experiments reported here. All mouse work was carried out in strict accordance with the approved protocols by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":536,"end":543},"obj":"Q9H0F6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
