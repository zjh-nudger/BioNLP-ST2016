Very low levels of TNF-\u03b1 were induced in PBM after stimulation with native CGN (Fig. 2A). Addition of 0.1 mg/ml 10 kDa dCGN resulted in approximately a 60-fold increase in TNF-\u03b1 production by PBM. This was a dose-dependent effect that reached a 180-fold increase when cells were exposed to 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (Fig. 2A). A 250-fold increase in TNF-\u03b1 production was detected at 1 mg/ml 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 2A). TNF-\u03b1 production increased in time reaching a maximum level at 8 hours of culture (Figure 2B). After 24 h, the amount of secreted TNF-\u03b1 was still one third of the total TNF-\u03b1. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known activator of immune cells also induced TNF-\u03b1 production with similar kinetics as dCGN (Fig. 2B). However, the amount of TNF-\u03b1 produced by LPS was 4-fold less than the one produced by dCGN and it was not detected after 8 hours of culture (Fig. 2B). Similarly, monocytic THP-1 cells cultivated in the presence of variable concentration of dCGN showed an increase in TNF-\u03b1 production (Fig. 2C). This increase in TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly smaller (about 10-fold) than the one presented by PBM (Fig. 2A). No TNF-\u03b1 was released from THP-1 cells exposed to native CGN (not shown). TNF-\u03b1 production by THP-1 cells was not dose dependent to the amount of dCGN used. Also there was no difference between the two forms (10 and 40 kDa) of dCGN (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 release from THP-1 cells stimulated with dCGN reached a maximum level at 32 h, while stimulation with LPS reached a maximum level at 56 h (Fig. 2D).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":21,"end":24},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":26},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":112,"end":115},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":112,"end":117},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":234,"end":237},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":234,"end":239},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":387,"end":390},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":387,"end":392},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":562,"end":565},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":562,"end":567},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":626,"end":629},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":626,"end":631},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":756,"end":759},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":756,"end":761},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":795,"end":798},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":795,"end":800},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":875,"end":878},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":875,"end":880},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":956,"end":959},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":956,"end":961},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1203},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1205},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1248},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1250},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1348,"end":1351},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1348,"end":1353},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1419,"end":1422},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1419,"end":1424},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1603,"end":1606},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1603,"end":1608},"obj":"P01375"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
