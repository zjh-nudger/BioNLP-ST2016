It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3\u2013 cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells. However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3\u2013. In fact both populations showed similarly enhanced proliferation (Figure 6A). Furthermore the TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25\u2013FOXP3+ minority, since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3+ cells were not confined to the highly divided cells. CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-\u03b2\u2013treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-\u03b2 and IL-4.\nThe addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells (Figure 6B). In line with the previous findings, the IL-4\u2013producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations. Since FOXP3 is known to act as a repressor of cytokine expression [20], we therefore analyzed GATA3 and FOXP3 expression. The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4\u20138), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; Figure 6C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3.\nThese results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-\u03b2 signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":17},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":53,"end":58},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":67,"end":71},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":73,"end":77},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":94,"end":98},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":123,"end":127},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":152,"end":157},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":180,"end":185},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":217,"end":222},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":289,"end":293},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":365,"end":370},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":400,"end":408},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":423,"end":428},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":516,"end":520},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":567,"end":572},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":587,"end":592},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":689,"end":694},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":717,"end":722},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":768,"end":772},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":773,"end":778},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":810,"end":815},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":854,"end":857},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":858,"end":864},"obj":"P08575"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":903,"end":908},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":963,"end":967},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":990,"end":997},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1094,"end":1099},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1108},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1126,"end":1130},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1188},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1249,"end":1253},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1278,"end":1283},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1344},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1427,"end":1432},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1437,"end":1442},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1506,"end":1510},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1515,"end":1520},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1539,"end":1544},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1549,"end":1554},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1780,"end":1785},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1840,"end":1845},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1873,"end":1877},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1911,"end":1916},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1954,"end":1959},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":2044,"end":2049},"obj":"P23771"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
