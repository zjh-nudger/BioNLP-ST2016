Similarly, pGL3-APOprom502 (containing sequence \u2212436/+66), pGL3-APOprom225 (containing sequence \u2212159/+66) and further 5\u2032 deletion reporter constructs containing 180, 150, 120 or 60\u2009bp upstream of position +65 were generated (Figure 3A). In order to analyze transcriptional activity, the luciferase reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into A3.01\u2009T cells. Luciferase assays revealed a \u223c20-fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025\u2009bp sequence as compared to the empty vector, indicating that we had identified an active A3G promoter sequence (Figure 3B). This transcription rate was not significantly altered by the 5\u2032 deletions leading to the 502, 225 and 180\u2009bp fragments (Figure 3B). In contrast, a drop in luciferase activity was observed in the case of the 150\u2009bp fragment. This construct only retained 28% of the transcriptional activity of the 180\u2009bp promoter in A3.01\u2009T cells and activity of the 120\u2009bp fragment was further reduced. Comparable reductions relative to the activity of 180\u2009bp fragment were observed in the myeloid cell line U937 and the hepatic cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 (Figure 3C), indicating that the core promoter of A3G is located within the region \u2212114/+66 relative to the TSS.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":21,"end":24},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":63,"end":71},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":111,"end":114},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":176,"end":184},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":256,"end":266},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":622,"end":632},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":700,"end":710},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":874,"end":877},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1074},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1325},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1497,"end":1500},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1539,"end":1547},"obj":"Q04864"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
