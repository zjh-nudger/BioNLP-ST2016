Allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice by negative selection kit (Invitrogen) and were then added at 2.5\u00d7105 and co-cultured with activated BMDC. After 5 days, supernatant was collected and the secretion of IFN\u03b3, IL4, IL2, and IL17A measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Both negative controls show no production of aforementioned cytokines.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":205,"end":208},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":434,"end":437},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":439,"end":442},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":448,"end":453},"obj":"Q16552"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":549,"end":552},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":577,"end":580},"obj":"P01730"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
