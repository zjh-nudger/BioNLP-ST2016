Among the I\u03baB molecules, I\u03baB\u03b1 is highly induced by NF-\u03baB activation [40]. Having shown that PKC regulated NF-\u03baB activity in M-CSF-stimulated MDMs, we next determined whether inhibition of PKC activity decreased expression of NF-\u03baB-regulated genes. We treated both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes and then stimulated with M-CSF. I\u03baB\u03b1 gene was measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, M-CSF enhanced I\u03baB\u03b1 gene expression and PKC inhibition by Ro-31-8220 decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 gene expression in both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells (p<0.01), demonstrating that PKC affected NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression in macrophages.\nTo further define the role of PKC in mediating human MDM survival in response to M-CSF, we examined the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-xL, which is also regulated by NF-\u03baB. As shown in Figure 6C, Ro-31-8220 reduced M-CSF-stimulated BCL-xL expression compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle control DMSO (p<0.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":2,"end":5},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":245,"end":250},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":247,"end":250},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":484,"end":489},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":486,"end":489},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":491,"end":495},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":557,"end":562},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":559,"end":562},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":572,"end":576},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":636,"end":640},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":861,"end":866},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":863,"end":866},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1011},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1011},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1077},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1074,"end":1077},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
