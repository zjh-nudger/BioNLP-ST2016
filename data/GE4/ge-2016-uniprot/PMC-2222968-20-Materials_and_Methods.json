For cell surface marker staining, cells were incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in staining buffer with the following antibodies: anti\u2013CD152-PE (CTLA-4; BD), anti\u2013PD-1 (eBiosciences), anti-GITR (R & D Systems), anti-CD69 (Beckman Coulter), anti-CD103 (DakoCytomation), anti-CD62L (Beckman Coulter), or anti-HLA-DR (Beckman Coulter). The controls were FITC, PE, or ECD-conjugated mouse IgG1 or rat IgG2a. For staining of mouse cells, the following mAbs from BD Biosciences were used following standard techniques as described above: anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD25. Anti-Fc\u03b3RII/III antibody (2.4G2, ATCC) was included in all stainings to reduce nonspecific antibody binding. To isolate naive murine CD4 T cells from murine DO11.10 or DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 T cells, cells were stained with anti-CD25-FITC, anti-CD62L-PE, and anti-CD4-APC prior to sorting. Dead cells were excluded with 4\u2032',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). To analyze murine Foxp3 expression in inducible Treg cultures, cells were stained intracellularly with anti-Foxp3-PE according to manufacturer's instruction, in conjunction with anti-CD4-APC and LIVE/DEAD fixable dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen) to discriminate live cells. All monoclonal antibodies for murine cell stainings were purchased from eBioscience or BD Biosciences.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":37},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":273,"end":278},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":642,"end":647},"obj":"P14151"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":905,"end":908},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":905,"end":908},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":905,"end":908},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":905,"end":908},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":915,"end":918},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":929,"end":933},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1071},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1120},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1159,"end":1163},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1175,"end":1180},"obj":"P14151"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1194,"end":1197},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1307,"end":1312},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1397,"end":1402},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1472,"end":1475},"obj":"P01730"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
