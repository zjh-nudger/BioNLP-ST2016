Mechanisms underlying the NF-\u03baB deregulation by HIV-1 are relevant for immune dysfunction in AIDS. We report that in single round HIV-1 infection, or single-pulse PMA stimulation, the HIV-1 Tat transactivator activated NF-\u03baB by hijacking the inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 and by preventing the repressor binding to the NF-\u03baB complex. Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB and increased the p65 DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity. The arginine- and cysteine-rich domains of Tat were required for I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF-\u03baB activity. Among an array of NF-\u03baB-responsive genes, Tat mostly activated the MIP-1\u03b1 expression in a p65-dependent manner, and bound to the MIP-1\u03b1 NF-\u03baB enhancer thus promoting the recruitment of p65 with displacement of I\u03baB-\u03b1; similar findings were obtained for the NF-\u03baB-responsive genes CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2. Our results support a novel mechanism of NF-\u03baB activation via physical interaction of Tat with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV-1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":34},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":31,"end":34},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":31,"end":34},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":31,"end":34},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":91,"end":94},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":91,"end":94},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":428,"end":431},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":428,"end":431},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":428,"end":431},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":428,"end":431},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":592,"end":595},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":592,"end":595},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":631,"end":634},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":631,"end":634},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":729,"end":732},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":729,"end":732},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":729,"end":732},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":729,"end":732},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":761,"end":764},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":761,"end":764},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":873,"end":876},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":873,"end":876},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":873,"end":876},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":873,"end":876},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":898,"end":904},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":921,"end":924},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":921,"end":924},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":960,"end":966},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1019},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1019},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1114},"obj":"P09919"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1119},"obj":"P01374"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1121,"end":1127},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1136},"obj":"O60603"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1227},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1227},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1227},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1227},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1246},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1246},"obj":"P21579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
