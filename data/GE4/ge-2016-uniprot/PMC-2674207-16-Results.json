We therefore investigated whether corticosteroids affect anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated nuclear import of GATA-3. Stimulation of cells with anti-CD3/CD28 resulted in a rapid cytoplasmic/nuclear GATA-3 translocation (Figure 1A), confirming our previous results [12]. We also confirmed a clear separation of nuclear and cytosolic fractions as indicated by histone H1 and MEK-1 markers (Figure 1B). The potent topical corticosteroid FP caused sustained loss of nuclear GATA-3 expression and cytoplasmic retention of GATA-3 at concentrations ranging from 10\u221212 to 10\u22128 M, which cover the therapeutic range [37]. This effect was concentration- and time-dependent, with a peak effect of 11.6-fold at 30 min at a concentration of 10\u22128 M (Figure 1C) and was associated with marked reductions in anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression (Figure 1D) and a loss of GATA-3 binding to the native IL-5 promoter (Figure 1E).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":39},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":66,"end":70},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":120,"end":126},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":137,"end":141},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":247,"end":250},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":247,"end":250},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":247,"end":250},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":247,"end":250},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":251,"end":255},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":285,"end":291},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":324,"end":327},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":324,"end":327},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":324,"end":327},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":324,"end":327},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":328,"end":332},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":373,"end":379},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":548,"end":553},"obj":"Q02750"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":645,"end":651},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":692,"end":698},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":971,"end":974},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":971,"end":974},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":971,"end":974},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":971,"end":974},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":975,"end":979},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":991,"end":995},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1004},"obj":"P05113"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1053},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1080},"obj":"P05113"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
