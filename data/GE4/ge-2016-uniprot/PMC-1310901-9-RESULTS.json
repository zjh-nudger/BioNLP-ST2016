Here, we demonstrate the absence of IRF-4 expression in various hematopoietic cell lines, such as Jurkat, a T-cell leukemia, CML-T1, a bcr-abl-positive T-cell line, K-562, a bcr-abl-positve erythroleukemia, U-937, a monocytic leukemia, EM-2 and LAMA-84, bcr-abl-positve myeloid leukemia, but not in SD-1, a bcr-abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre B-ALL), RPMI-8226, a multiple myeloma and BV-173, a bcr-abl-positive B-cell line (Figures 1A and 5D). After sequencing of the IRF-4 promoter, it could be excluded that absence of IRF-4 expression in any of the above cell lines was due to genetic aberrations. However, 2 bp changes (nucleotide \u22121081, T\u2192C and \u22121068, A\u2192C) could be detected in both the IRF-4-positive BV-173 and the IRF-4-negative LAMA-84, EM-2 and K-562 (Figure 1B). At position \u2212116 an A\u2192C substitution was found in EM-2, K-562 and CML-T1, whereas Jurkat, BV-173 and SD-1 exhibited a mixed A/C sequence and U-937, LAMA-84 and RPMI-8226 no substitution at all (Figure 1B). Consequently, these alterations are unlikely to affect IRF-4 expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":16},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":123,"end":128},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":234,"end":239},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":333,"end":336},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":337,"end":340},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":372,"end":375},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":376,"end":379},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":452,"end":455},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":456,"end":459},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":509,"end":512},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":608,"end":611},"obj":"P11274"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":612,"end":615},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":682,"end":687},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":735,"end":740},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":906,"end":911},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":936,"end":941},"obj":"Q15306"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1249,"end":1254},"obj":"Q15306"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
