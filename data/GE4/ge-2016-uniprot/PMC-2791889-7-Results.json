We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352) (Figure\u00a05D and Figure\u00a0S5B). In contrast, inhibitors of p38 MAPK or of GSK-3\u03b2 activation did not affect the expression of IL-10 by these subsets (Figure\u00a0S5B). Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":53,"end":57},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":62,"end":66},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":97,"end":102},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":158,"end":162},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":167,"end":171},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":224,"end":227},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":224,"end":227},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":224,"end":227},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":224,"end":227},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":237,"end":241},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":412,"end":416},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":421,"end":425},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":483,"end":488},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":526,"end":531},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":696,"end":699},"obj":"O15264"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":696,"end":699},"obj":"Q15759"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":696,"end":699},"obj":"Q16539"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":696,"end":699},"obj":"P53778"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":762,"end":767},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":817,"end":821},"obj":"P27361"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":826,"end":830},"obj":"P28482"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":904,"end":909},"obj":"P22301"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
