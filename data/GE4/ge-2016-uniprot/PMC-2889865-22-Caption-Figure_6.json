Jurkat T-cells were incubated with PKC- and JNK inhibitors for 1 h followed by stimulation with PMA (162 nM) for 24 h. (A) CXCL8 expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both inhibitors. (B) JNK-I revealed a stronger inhibitory effect on IL-6 expression than the PKC-I. (C) TNF expression was not affected by either inhibitor. Statistical significance from the positive control (PMA) was determined using Student's t-test.
