In the absence of serum, monocytes die via apoptosis [1], [2]. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) stimulates mononuclear phagocyte survival and differentiation [3]. Importantly, M-CSF-mediated cell survival and activation is associated with a variety of human diseases, including atherosclerosis, transplant vascular sclerosis and breast cancer metastasis [4], [5], [6].\nWe previously identified that NF-\u03baB activation is important in M-CSF-induced monocyte survival [7]. In addition to its role in mononuclear phagocyte survival, the transcription factor NF-\u03baB regulates numerous genes that play important roles in cellular signaling, stress response, cell growth, survival, differentiation and inflammation [8]. There are five members in the NF-\u03baB family: RelA/p65, p50, p52, c-Rel and RelB. The most common activating complex is the p50/p65 heterodimer, driven by the activation domain in the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit. NF-\u03baB p65 regulates important developmental processes [9], [10]. Mice lacking NF-\u03baB p65 die in utero and have extensive liver damage via enhanced apoptosis [9]. Embryonic macrophages from NF-\u03baB p65 null mice are susceptible to TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis which is rescued by overexpressing the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit [10]. Moreover, inhibiting NF-\u03baB induces cell death in many cell types and cytokine-independent survival is mediated by constitutively active NF-\u03baB in murine macrophages [11].\nIn monocytes and macrophages, NF-\u03baB is an important transcriptional factor for expression of cytokines and cell surface receptors [12]. However, unlike resting T-cells, NF-\u03baB is constitutively present in the nuclei of primary monocytes and monocytic cell lines in the absence of exogenous stimuli as demonstrated by mobility shift analysis [13]. Similarly, constitutively active NF-\u03baB was observed in human alveolar macrophages [14].\nIn the classic/canonical pathway, the NF-\u03baB p50/p65 complex is sequestered in the cytosol by I\u03baB\u03b1 [15]. Upon stimulation by cytokines or UV radiation, I\u03baB\u03b1 is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, releasing NF-\u03baB p50/p65 to translocate to the nucleus and transactivate target genes. After its release from I\u03baB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p65 can undergo post-translational modification to activate gene transcription. The role of NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation on NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity varies by stimulus, time of stimulation and cell type [16]. Previous research shows that phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 at Ser276, Ser529 or Ser536 plays an important role in regulating transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB [17]. In TNF\u03b1-treated murine fibroblasts, Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65 is phosphorylated by MSK1 to enhance NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity [18]. In macrophages treated with endotoxin, NF-\u03baB transcription activity is associated with phosphorylation on Ser276 and Ser536 that is regulated through protein kinase A (PKA) and IKK\u03b2 respectively[16], [19]. In human T cells, NF-\u03baB p65 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser536 to facilitate NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation following cellular stimulation [20]. Accumulating evidence reveals that NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 is crucial for its transcriptional activity. Upon nuclear translocation, phosphorylation of Ser276 on NF-\u03baB p65 by PKA recruits the transcription co-activator, p300 to potentiate NF-\u03baB-regulated gene transcription [21]. However, other studies show that PKA inhibits NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression by stabilizing I\u03baB\u03b1 [22], [23]. Interestingly, the serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 directly phosphorylates NF-\u03baB p65 at Ser276 by stabilizing to prevent ubiquitin-proteasome degradation [24]. Several other phosphorylation sites are also described to enhance NF-\u03baB gene transactivation [25].\nHere, we investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in M-CSF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation. PKC proteins are multifunctional kinases that differ in structure, function and co-factor requirement [26]. PKCs are involved in diverse cell responses, including cell growth, survival, differentiation and development [27]. The 12 closely related enzymes of the PKC family are divided into three classes: conventional (cPKCs: \u03b1 \u03b2I \u03b2II and \u03b3 require Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG); novel (nPKCs: \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b7, \u03b8 and \u03bc) require DAG; and atypical (aPKCs: \u03be, \u03b9 and \u03bb) require neither Ca2+ nor DAG. Monocytes and macrophages predominantly express conventional PKC isoforms (PKC\u03b1 PKC\u03b2I and PKC\u03b2II) and novel PKCs (PKC\u03b4 and PKC\u03b5). Conventional PKCs regulate differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 to macrophages [28]. PKC\u03b1 induces IL-1\u03b1, iNOS and TNF\u03b1 mRNA production after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure [29]. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that conventional PKCs like PKC\u03b1 have anti-apoptotic functions. For example, PKC\u03b1 is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells including gliomas, liver, and lung [30], [31]. In epithelial cells, inhibition of PKC\u03b1 induces PKC\u03b4-dependent apoptosis [31]. Interestingly, in human monocytes and premonocytic THP-1 leukemia cells, novel PKCs like PKC\u03b4 have the opposite effect on cell survival, Voss et al showed that PKC\u03b4 directly phosphorylates caspase-3 and promotes etoposide-induced apoptosis [32]. Moreover, knockout mouse studies suggest that another novel PKC, PKC\u03b5 is critically involved in early LPS-mediated signaling in activated macrophages [33].\nPreviously, we reported that M-CSF promotes monocyte survival through the activation of the PI3-K/AKT pathway [3]. In addition to AKT activation, M-CSF stimulates PKC in human monocytes and increases NF-\u03baB DNA binding [34]. However, whether PKC and/or NF-\u03baB activation is critical in M-CSF-stimulated mononuclear phagocyte survival and/or differentiation is unclear. In other cells, PKC plays an important role in NF-\u03baB activation and cell survival [35], however the specific mechanisms of this activation and the biological effects on cellular phenotype are not known. Therefore, we focused at understanding the role of PKC in the regulation of NF-\u03baB activation and M-CSF-induced monocyte survival.\nHere we demonstrates that M-CSF upregulated the NF-\u03baB transcription and cell survival in human and mouse macrophages. This activity was reduced by the conventional, but not novel, PKC inhibitors, dominant negative PKC\u03b1 constructs or PKC\u03b1 siRNA. Conventional PKC regulated NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression and phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65 occurred in an M-CSF-dependent fashion correlating with its maximal transcriptional activity. Furthermore, PKC\u03b1-regulated phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65 plays an important role in regulating its activity in mononuclear phagocytes and murine embryonic fibroblasts.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":149,"end":185},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":160,"end":185},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":187,"end":192},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":189,"end":192},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":274,"end":279},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":276,"end":279},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":530,"end":535},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":532,"end":535},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":853,"end":857},"obj":"Q04206-3"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":853,"end":857},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":858,"end":861},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":858,"end":861},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":863,"end":866},"obj":"P19838"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":868,"end":871},"obj":"Q00653"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":873,"end":878},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":875,"end":878},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":883,"end":887},"obj":"Q01201"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":931,"end":934},"obj":"P19838"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":935,"end":938},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":935,"end":938},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":997,"end":1000},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":997,"end":1000},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1019},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1019},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1094,"end":1097},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1094,"end":1097},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1204,"end":1207},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1204,"end":1207},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1305,"end":1308},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1305,"end":1308},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1971,"end":1974},"obj":"P19838"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1975,"end":1978},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1975,"end":1978},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":2020,"end":2024},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":2078,"end":2082},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":2147,"end":2150},"obj":"P19838"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":2151,"end":2154},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":2151,"end":2154},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":2240,"end":2244},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":2252,"end":2255},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":2252,"end":2255},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":2350,"end":2353},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":2350,"end":2353},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":2518,"end":2521},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":2518,"end":2521},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":2680,"end":2683},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":2680,"end":2683},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":2705,"end":2709},"obj":"O75582"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":2935,"end":2939},"obj":"O14920"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":2988,"end":2991},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2988,"end":2991},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":3055,"end":3058},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":3055,"end":3058},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":3159,"end":3162},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":3159,"end":3162},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":3297,"end":3300},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":3297,"end":3300},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":3349,"end":3353},"obj":"Q09472"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":3502,"end":3506},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":3598,"end":3601},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":3598,"end":3601},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":3835,"end":3840},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":3837,"end":3840},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":4433,"end":4437},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":4448,"end":4454},"obj":"P05771"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":4472,"end":4476},"obj":"Q05655"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":4603,"end":4607},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":4771,"end":4775},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":4820,"end":4824},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":4952,"end":4956},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":4965,"end":4969},"obj":"Q05655"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":5085,"end":5089},"obj":"Q05655"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":5156,"end":5160},"obj":"Q05655"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":5185,"end":5194},"obj":"P42574"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":5427,"end":5432},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin"
