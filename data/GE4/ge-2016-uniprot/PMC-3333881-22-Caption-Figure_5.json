HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27), p3xFLAG-Tat R(49\u201357) or empty vector (10\u2009\u00b5g); for p65 RNA interference, cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g) and siRNA p65 or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol). Twenty-four-hour post-transfection, total RNA was extracted and analysed by real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of MIP-1\u03b1 (A), CSF3 (B), LTA (C), NFKBIA (D), TLR2 (E), GAPDH (F), ACTB (G) genes. (H) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, or empty vector (10\u2009\u00b5g) and 48\u2009h later ChIP was performed with anti-p65 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (I) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with empty vector, or p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g) in presence or absence of siRNA p65, or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol); 48\u2009h later, ChIP was performed with anti-FLAG antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (J) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with empty vector, p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g), or empty vector plus siRNA I\u03baB-\u03b1 or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol); 48\u2009h later, ChIP was performed with anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. Values (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093) are shown. The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control (empty vector) according to the Student's t-test (P\u2009<\u20090.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":120,"end":123},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":120,"end":123},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":212,"end":215},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":212,"end":215},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":212,"end":215},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":212,"end":215},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":225,"end":228},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":225,"end":228},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":225,"end":228},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":225,"end":228},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":250,"end":253},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":250,"end":253},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":250,"end":253},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":250,"end":253},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":360,"end":363},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":360,"end":363},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":360,"end":363},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":360,"end":363},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":382,"end":385},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":382,"end":385},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":535,"end":541},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":547,"end":551},"obj":"P09919"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":557,"end":560},"obj":"P01374"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":566,"end":572},"obj":"P25963"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":578,"end":582},"obj":"O60603"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":588,"end":593},"obj":"P04406"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":599,"end":603},"obj":"P60709"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":670,"end":673},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":670,"end":673},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":670,"end":673},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":670,"end":673},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":743,"end":746},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":743,"end":746},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":908,"end":911},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":908,"end":911},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":908,"end":911},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":908,"end":911},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":952,"end":955},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":952,"end":955},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1193},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1193},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1193},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1193},"obj":"P04605"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
