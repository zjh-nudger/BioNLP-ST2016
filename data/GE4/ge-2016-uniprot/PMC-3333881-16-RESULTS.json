To detect the Tat protein, we produced HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R\u2212E\u2212 virions, which were used in single-round infection of U937, a human monocytic cell line. Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF-\u03baB activation following viral infection. The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3- to 12-h post-infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 6A).\nThe NF-\u03baB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat-negative cells (siRNA Tat), and increased at 12\u2009h only in Tat-positive cells (Figure 6B). Degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 was observed at 3-h post-infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of I\u03baB-\u03b1 at 12\u2009h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6C). Consistently, the IKK activity was induced at 3-h post-infection and turned off at 12\u2009h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6D). These results agreed with the kinetic of NF-\u03baB activation in single-round HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells (Figure 1), and further supported the requirement of viral expression to counteract the post-activation turn off of NF-\u03baB.\nIn HIV-1-infected U937 cells, the endogenous Tat was coimmunoprecipitated with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65 (Figure 6E), and activated the MIP-1\u03b1 expression in a p65-dependent manner, as shown by the lack of effect following RNA interference of Tat or p65 (Figure 6F). Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF-\u03baB enhancer of MIP-1\u03b1, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat (Figure 6G and H). Altogether these results indicated that in single round HIV-1 infection Tat associated with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65, and induced the p65-dependent activation of MIP-1\u03b1 expression through occupancy of the MIP-1\u03b1 promoter and increased recruitment of p65.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":107,"end":113},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":144,"end":147},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":144,"end":147},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":173,"end":176},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":173,"end":176},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":173,"end":176},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":173,"end":176},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":227,"end":233},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":282,"end":285},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":282,"end":285},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":282,"end":285},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":282,"end":285},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":312,"end":315},"obj":"P04578"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":339,"end":342},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":339,"end":342},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":339,"end":342},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":339,"end":342},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":471,"end":474},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":471,"end":474},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":471,"end":474},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":471,"end":474},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":643,"end":646},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":643,"end":646},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":643,"end":646},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":643,"end":646},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"P04585"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"P03366"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"P04591"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"P12497"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":736,"end":739},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":736,"end":739},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":736,"end":739},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":736,"end":739},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":806,"end":809},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":806,"end":809},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":865,"end":868},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":865,"end":868},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":865,"end":868},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":865,"end":868},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":911,"end":914},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":911,"end":914},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":911,"end":914},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":911,"end":914},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":937,"end":940},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":937,"end":940},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":937,"end":940},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":937,"end":940},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":973,"end":976},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":973,"end":976},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":973,"end":976},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":973,"end":976},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1141},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1141},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1141},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1141},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1276},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1276},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1276},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1276},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T68","span":{"begin":1573,"end":1576},"obj":"P04605"},{"id":"nfkb_T69","span":{"begin":1573,"end":1576},"obj":"P04610"},{"id":"nfkb_T70","span":{"begin":1573,"end":1576},"obj":"Q8UMQ1"},{"id":"nfkb_T71","span":{"begin":1573,"end":1576},"obj":"P04608"},{"id":"nfkb_T72","span":{"begin":1617,"end":1620},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T73","span":{"begin":1617,"end":1620},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T74","span":{"begin":1652,"end":1658},"obj":"P10147"},{"id":"nfkb_T75","span":{"begin":1675,"end":1678},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T76","span":{"begin":1675,"end":1678},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T77","span":{"begin":1758,"end":1761},"obj":"P04
