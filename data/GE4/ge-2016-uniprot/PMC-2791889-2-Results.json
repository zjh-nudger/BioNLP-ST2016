Culture with high doses of antigen for 7 days gave rise to Th1 cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 upon restimulation (Constant et\u00a0al., 1995; Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), but not IL-10 (Figure\u00a0S1A available online). Culture with low antigen doses under the same conditions led to the differentiation of Th2 cells, which expressed both IL-4 and IL-10 upon restimulation (Figure\u00a0S1A). Culture of naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (Figure\u00a0S1B).\nTo investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12. At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-\u03b3 expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure\u00a01A). Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure\u00a01A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B). Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen. Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 and lost their\u00a0capacity to produce IL-2 (Figure\u00a01B). Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ T\u00a0cells at both high and\u00a0low antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells\u00a0is most likely not related to limited IL-2. Naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T\u00a0cells or Treg cells (Figure\u00a0S2). Although it has been suggested that TGF-\u03b2 can induce IL-10 in CD4+ T\u00a0cells (Kitani et\u00a0al., 2003; Schiott et\u00a0al., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown). In fact, neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 led to increased IL-10 production by both T\u00a0cell subsets (Figure\u00a0S3). Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-\u03b2 or on the presence of other T\u00a0cell types.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":78,"end":83},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":138,"end":143},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":148,"end":153},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":205,"end":208},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":268,"end":277},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":295,"end":298},"obj":"E2RVI8"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":381,"end":386},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":460,"end":465},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":616,"end":620},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":625,"end":630},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":681,"end":684},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":741,"end":744},"obj":"P04234"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":741,"end":744},"obj":"P07766"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":741,"end":744},"obj":"P20963"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":741,"end":744},"obj":"P09693"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":754,"end":758},"obj":"P10747"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":789,"end":794},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":789,"end":794},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":807,"end":812},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":867,"end":872},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":917,"end":921},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":971,"end":976},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1027,"end":1032},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1104},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1104},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1127},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1210},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1210},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1242},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1242},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1294,"end":1299},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1339},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1373},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1373},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1427},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1540,"end":1545},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1540,"end":1545},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1578,"end":1583},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1630,"end":1635},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1729,"end":1734},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1749,"end":1754},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T44","span":{"begin":1749,"end":1754},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T45","span":{"begin":1835,"end":1840},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T46","span":{"begin":1845,"end":1850},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T47","span":{"begin":1886,"end":1890},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T48","span":{"begin":1928,"end":1933},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T49","span":{"begin":1928,"end":1933},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T50","span":{"begin":1963,"end":1966},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T51","span":{"begin":2050,"end":2055},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T52","span":{"begin":2092,"end":2097},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T53","span":{"begin":2152,"end":2156},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T54","span":{"begin":2164,"end":2167},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T55","span":{"begin":2303,"end":2308},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T56","span":{"begin":2303,"end":2308},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T57","span":{"begin":2327,"end":2332},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T58","span":{"begin":2514,"end":2519},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T59","span":{"begin":2531,"end":2536},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T60","span":{"begin":2540,"end":2543},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T61","span":{"begin":2711,"end":2716},"obj":"P01137"},{"id":"nfkb_T62","span":{"begin":2734,"end":2739},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T63","span":{"begin":2812,"end":2817},"obj":"P22301"},{"id":"nfkb_T64","span":{"begin":2871,"end":2876},"obj":"P29459"},{"id":"nfkb_T65","span":{"begin":2871,"end":2876},"obj":"P29460"},{"id":"nfkb_T66","span":{"begin":2950,"end":2954},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T67","span":{"begin":2958,"end":2963},"obj":"P01137"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
