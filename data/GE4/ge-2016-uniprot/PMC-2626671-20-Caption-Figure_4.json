Runx3+/+ or Runx3\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells were activated and transduced with retroviruses bearing an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP) or also encoding Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or Myc-Runx3 (Runx3). The frequency of transduced cells in the cultures was equivalent for all constructs (\u223c75\u201390% GFP+ cells; not depicted). (A) Protein expression in whole-cell extracts (day 6) was analyzed by immunoblotting. Overexpression of Eomes-VP16 cannot be detected with the Eomes antibody, as the C-terminal epitope is within the region that has been replaced with the VP16 transactivation domain. (B) Expression of granzyme B and IFN-\u03b3 after culture for 6 d and restimulation for 4 h with PMA and ionomycin was determined by intracellular staining. The percentage of positively stained cells is shown above the gate; the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of granzyme B staining for the total population is shown below the gate. The vertical gray lines indicate the MFI for WT GFP+ cells. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments. (C) Schematic diagram of the transcriptional network involving Runx3 and T-box factors. T-bet is induced by TCR signals and is essential for early IFN-\u03b3 expression. Runx3 is present in naive CD8+ T cells and represses Runx1 and induces Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-\u03b3 expression. Eomes may participate in sustaining late IFN-\u03b3 expression, whereas Runx3 and Eomes (but not T-bet) may cooperate to activate perforin expression. The dotted line indicates the partial effect of T-bet deficiency on Gzmb mRNA but not granzyme B protein expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":15,"end":20},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":22,"end":30},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":32,"end":42},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":48,"end":53},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":95,"end":100},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":104,"end":107},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":104,"end":107},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":187,"end":190},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":201,"end":204},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":223,"end":228},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":235,"end":242},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":247,"end":250},"obj":"P01106"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":251,"end":256},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":258,"end":263},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":359,"end":362},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":490,"end":495},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":529,"end":534},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":671,"end":681},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":686,"end":691},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":914,"end":924},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1035},"obj":"Q9U6Y4"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1175,"end":1180},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1205},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1264},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1277,"end":1282},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1303,"end":1306},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1303,"end":1306},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1335},"obj":"Q01196"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1348,"end":1353},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1363},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1365,"end":1375},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1381,"end":1386},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1399,"end":1404},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1440,"end":1445},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1466,"end":1471},"obj":"Q13761"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1476,"end":1481},"obj":"O95936"},{"id":"nfkb_T39","span":{"begin":1491,"end":1496},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T40","span":{"begin":1524,"end":1532},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T41","span":{"begin":1593,"end":1598},"obj":"Q9UL17"},{"id":"nfkb_T42","span":{"begin":1613,"end":1617},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T43","span":{"begin":1631,"end":1641},"obj":"P10144"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
