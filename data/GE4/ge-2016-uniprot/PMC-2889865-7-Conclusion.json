Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA was more potent than HK E. coli at elevating the CXCL8 levels. PMA induced AP-1 activation and down-regulated NF-\u03baB while HK E. coli up-regulated NF-\u03baB without affecting AP-1 activity. In addition, the temporal induction pattern of AP-1 correlated to the release of CXCL8 while IL-6 followed the NF-\u03baB activity. Likewise, blocking NF-\u03baB activation resulted in a complete inhibition of IL-6 while the CXCL8 levels remained elevated as shown both at the protein and mRNA level. Furthermore, the CXCL8 release was down-regulated by inhibition of JNK activity. The present study indicates that in Jurkat T-cells, IL-6 is regulated through NF-\u03baB while CXCL8 regulation is independent of NF-\u03baB and closely associated with AP-1 activation.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":26},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":88,"end":93},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":131,"end":135},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":232,"end":237},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":258,"end":262},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":353,"end":357},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":415,"end":419},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":449,"end":454},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":461,"end":465},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":568,"end":572},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":583,"end":588},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":676,"end":681},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":792,"end":796},"obj":"P05231"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":830,"end":835},"obj":"P10145"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":899,"end":903},"obj":"P05412"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
