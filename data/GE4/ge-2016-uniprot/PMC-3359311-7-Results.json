To validate its use in this study as an NF-\u03baB inhibitor, western blots for pro-IL-1\u03b2 were performed alongside inhibition of CFTR activity by CFTRinh172 in response to PAO1 at 4 hours after stimulation (Fig. 7a). Our results indicate that Bay11-7082 prevents production of pro-IL-1\u03b2 whereas CFTRinh172 does not seem to affect it. This was further corroborated by the ability Bay11-7082 to inhibit I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 hours post PAO1 stimulation (Fig. 7b).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":24,"end":29},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":260,"end":265},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":457,"end":462},"obj":"P01584"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":577,"end":581},"obj":"P25963"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
