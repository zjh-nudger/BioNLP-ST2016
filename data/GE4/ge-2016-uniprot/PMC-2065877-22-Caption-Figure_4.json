The L32 and GAPDH housekeeping genes were used as a loading control. Arrow indicates the position of the protected probe.\n(B and C) Immunoblot analysis of WT and LMP1 transgenic mice for activated pStat6 in (B) purified B cells (CD19+) at the time of harvest or in (C) whole splenocytes cultured with or without IL4. (B) Actin was used as a loading control, and the white line indicates that intervening lanes have been spliced out.\n(D and E) MTS assay of (D) WT lymphocytes and (E) LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells cultured with IL4, a neutralizing antibody to IL4, or a rat IgG isotype control at the indicated concentrations. Shown are the results from LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 3. The results are the mean \u00b1 SEM of triplicate samples from a single representative experiment that was repeated twice with similar results.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"obj":"P03230"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":73},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":74,"end":79},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":132,"end":135},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":164,"end":168},"obj":"P15391"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"obj":"P03230"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":216,"end":219},"obj":"Q9BYC8"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":216,"end":219},"obj":"P62910"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":224,"end":229},"obj":"P04406"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":374,"end":378},"obj":"P03230"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":409,"end":415},"obj":"P42226"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":441,"end":445},"obj":"P15391"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":524,"end":527},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":695,"end":699},"obj":"P03230"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":740,"end":743},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":772,"end":775},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":866,"end":870},"obj":"P03230"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
