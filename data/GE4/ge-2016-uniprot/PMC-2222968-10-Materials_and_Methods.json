The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by FACS and was \u2265 95%. Monoclonality of T cell clones was confirmed by TCR-chain mapping and was identified to be Vbeta8 positive. The clones were characterized by high IL-4 secretion.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":27,"end":30},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":108,"end":111},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":197,"end":200},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":400,"end":404},"obj":"P05112"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
