To gain new insights into the transcriptional regulation of this restriction factor, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of A3G. Transcriptional start sites were identified by 5\u2032-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that a 1025\u2009bp A3G promoter sequence (from \u2212959 to +66 relative to the major transcriptional start site) displayed constitutive promoter activity. In T cells, the A3G promoter was not inducible by mitogenic stimulation, interferon treatment or expression of HIV-1 proteins. Using a series of 5\u2032 deletion promoter constructs in luciferase reporter assays, we identified a 180\u2009bp region that was sufficient for full promoter activity. Transcriptional activity of this A3G core promoter was dependent on a GC-box (located at position \u221287/\u221278 relative to the major transcriptional start site) and was abolished after mutation of this DNA element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the identified GC-box represented a binding site for the ubiquitous transcription factors specificity protein (Sp) 1 and Sp3.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"P08047"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":8,"end":11},"obj":"Q02447"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":54,"end":62},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":68,"end":76},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":78,"end":81},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":506,"end":516},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":561,"end":564},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":601,"end":609},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":709,"end":712},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":873,"end":883},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1015},"obj":"Q9HC16"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1093},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1407,"end":1410},"obj":"Q02447"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
