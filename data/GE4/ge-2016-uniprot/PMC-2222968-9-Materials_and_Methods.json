Transgenic DO11.10 mice, expressing a T cell receptor for OVA323\u2013339 peptide in the context of H-2d, were backcrossed with mice expressing GATA-3, driven by the human CD2 locus control region (CD2-GATA3) [22], resulting in DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 mice. Mice used for experiments were backcrossed on a BALB/c background for a minimum of eight generations and used at an age of 8\u201312 wk. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal studies were performed according to institutional and state guidelines.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":226,"end":232},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":254,"end":257},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"obj":"P06729"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":284,"end":289},"obj":"P23771"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":322,"end":327},"obj":"P23771"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
