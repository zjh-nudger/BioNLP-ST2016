J. Westwick and D.A. Brenner, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) contains three copies of NF-\u03baB-responsive element from the MHC class I locus, placed upstream of the luciferase gene. Human monocytic THP-1 cells were transiently transfected as previously described [30], and then cultured for 4 h alone or with increasing concentration of either C10 or C40. Luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer (Monolight 2010 Luminometer, Ann Arbor, MI).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":263,"end":273},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":454,"end":464},"obj":"P08659"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
