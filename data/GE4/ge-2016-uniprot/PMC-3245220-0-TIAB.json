The transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) is a key regulator of genes involved in M-CSF-induced mononuclear phagocyte survival and this study focused at identifying the mechanism of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation. Here, we demonstrate that M-CSF stimulated NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. The general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro-31-8220, the conventional PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor G\u00f6-6976, overexpression of dominant negative PKC\u03b1 constructs and PKC\u03b1 siRNA reduced NF-\u03baB activity in response to M-CSF. Interestingly, Ro-31-8220 reduced Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-\u03baBp65 leading to decreased M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. In this report, we identify conventional PKCs, including PKC\u03b1 as important upstream kinases for M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation, NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression, NF-\u03baB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation, and macrophage survival. Lastly, we find that NF-\u03baB p65 Ser276 plays an important role in basal and M-CSF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation in human mononuclear phagocytes.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":2,"end":5},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":103,"end":139},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":114,"end":139},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":141,"end":146},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":143,"end":146},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":302,"end":307},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":304,"end":307},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":462,"end":467},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":464,"end":467},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":676,"end":680},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":738,"end":742},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":758,"end":762},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":807,"end":812},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":809,"end":812},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":904,"end":909},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":906,"end":909},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":994,"end":998},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1038},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1038},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1123},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1123},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1203},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1203},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1248,"end":1253},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1253},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
