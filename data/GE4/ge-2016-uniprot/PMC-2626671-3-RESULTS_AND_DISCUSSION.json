Naive T cells showed detectable expression of perforin mRNA as well as perforin protein (Fig. 1, A\u2013D). Relative to its expression in naive T cells, perforin (Prf1) mRNA expression did not increase appreciably at day 2 but showed a reproducible decrease at day 4, followed by robust reexpression between days 4 and 8 (Fig. 1, A\u2013D). In contrast, granzyme B (Gzmb) mRNA was low or undetectable in naive T cells but was strongly up-regulated by day 2 after stimulation and increased progressively until day 6 (Fig. 1, A and B); similarly, granzyme B protein was expressed by day 4 and remained high until day 6 (Fig. 1 E). As expected, a small fraction of naive T cells expressed the cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF in response to stimulation, and this capacity increased significantly in differentiated cells (Fig. 1 E; see also Fig. 2 A).\nWe evaluated antigen-dependent cytolytic function in a short-term assay in which target cell death was measured within 2 h (Fig. 1 F). By limiting the duration of TCR stimulation, this strategy minimizes cytolysis secondary to new gene expression during the period of the assay. Naive T cells did not display significant cytolytic function in this short-term assay (unpublished data), most likely because they express immature (unprocessed) forms of perforin and lack the capacity to degranulate (18, 19). Even after activation for 2 or 4 d, the cells showed poor cytolytic activity (Fig. 1 F), in striking contrast to their capacity for efficient cytokine production (Fig. 1 E). Only cells cultured until day 6 displayed robust cytotoxicity, as judged by their ability to induce apoptosis in a large number of target cells (Fig. 1 F).\nThese results show that after a strong priming stimulus through TCRs and co-stimulatory receptors in vitro, granzyme B expression and the ability to produce effector cytokines are programmed early, whereas perforin expression and cytolytic function are induced later, during the phase of clonal expansion in IL-2. Therefore, the two major effector functions of CTL, cytokine production and cytolytic activity, are not intrinsically coregulated.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":40},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":55},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":152,"end":160},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":162,"end":172},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":205,"end":208},"obj":"P01732"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":205,"end":208},"obj":"P10966"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":284,"end":292},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":309,"end":317},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":341,"end":349},"obj":"Q04864"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":386,"end":394},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":396,"end":400},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":582,"end":592},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":594,"end":598},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":773,"end":783},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":928,"end":933},"obj":"P01579"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":938,"end":941},"obj":"P01375"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1517,"end":1525},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":2011,"end":2021},"obj":"P10144"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":2109,"end":2117},"obj":"P14222"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":2211,"end":2215},"obj":"P60568"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
