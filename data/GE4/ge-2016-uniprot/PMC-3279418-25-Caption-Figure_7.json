After 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with freshly isolated allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells (2.5\u00d7105 cells in 0.1 mL complete medium; MHC haplotype: H-2d). After 5 days, supernatants were collected and the secretion of IFN\u03b3, IL4, and IL2 were measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Samples from both negative controls had no detectable production of the aforementioned cytokines (not shown). Results are analyzed based on 2\u20134 mice per group. * P<0.05.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":71,"end":74},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":340,"end":343},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":486,"end":489},"obj":"P05112"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":495,"end":498},"obj":"P60568"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":599,"end":602},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":627,"end":630},"obj":"P01730"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
