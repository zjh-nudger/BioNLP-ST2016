Briefly, monocytes were resuspended in Amaxa Nucleofactor solution at a density of 20\u00d7106 cells/ml, and 2 \u00b5g of total plasmid DNA 100 nM of PKC\u03b1 siRNA or control siRNA was added and transfected using program Amaxa Y-01. For co-transfection studies, PKC\u03b1 or NF-\u03baB p65 constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5\u22361 with the reporter plasmid. Immediately after transfection, cells were washed with 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 10% FBS or serum free LGM medium (Lonza Walkersville Inc.) then plated at 4\u00d7105 cells/well in 24-well plates. The original medium was replaced by serum free LGM medium without or with M-CSF (100 ng/ml) one hour later. The next day, cell-free supernatants were collected for the SEAP analysis. Cells were stained with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI). For the inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitor for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium prior to the addition of M-CSF.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":338,"end":342},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":447,"end":451},"obj":"P17252"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":461,"end":464},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":461,"end":464},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":821,"end":826},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":823,"end":826},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":954,"end":963},"obj":"P08758"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1117},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":1114,"end":1117},"obj":"P04141"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
