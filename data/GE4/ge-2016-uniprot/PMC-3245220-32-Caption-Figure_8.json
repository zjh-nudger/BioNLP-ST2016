The cells were transfected for 18-24 hours, serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 \u00b5M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 100 ng/ml of M-CSF for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. (B) NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP along with empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-\u03baB p65 WT, NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A, or NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A. The cells were cultured for 24 hours and then serum starved for 4 hours. Cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are fold change over empty vector + pTAL-SEAP. (C) NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP with either empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-\u03baB p65 WT or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A. The cells were transfected for 24 hours and serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 \u00b5M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNF\u03b1. The supernatant were collected after 2 hours of treatment and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are the fold change over empty vector + pNF-\u03baB-SEAP. Data shown are mean \u00b1 S.E.M for at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":9},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":6,"end":9},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":186,"end":189},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":186,"end":189},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":202,"end":205},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":202,"end":205},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":381,"end":386},"obj":"P09603"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":383,"end":386},"obj":"P04141"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":456,"end":459},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":456,"end":459},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":575,"end":578},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":575,"end":578},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":589,"end":592},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":589,"end":592},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":610,"end":613},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":610,"end":613},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":876,"end":879},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":876,"end":879},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":996,"end":999},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":996,"end":999},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1015},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1015},"obj":"P21579"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
