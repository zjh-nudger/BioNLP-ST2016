Unlike full-length Foxp3, which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence-specific manner to forkhead binding sites, the \u0394FKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus cannot interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [16]. Therefore, we utilized the \u0394FKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization (or other function associated with the FKH domain) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-\u03baB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus. Overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not of \u0394FKH, was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF-\u03baB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells (Figure 2B). Both Foxp3 and \u0394FKH were expressed at very high levels following transfection as detected by real-time RT-PCR (unpublished data). These data appear to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is critically important for Foxp3 to down-regulate NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription. However, NF-\u03baB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full-length Foxp3 and \u0394FKH in Jurkat T cells (Figure 2C) and primary human CD4+ T cells (Figure 2D). Western blot analysis of NF-\u03baB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and \u0394FKH does not block NF-\u03baB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E). These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations. Alternative interpretations may include the possibility that the localization of \u0394FKH differ between epithelial cells and T cells. In either case, these results suggest a cell type-specific mechanism of action for this Foxp3 mutant.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":131},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":217,"end":222},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":293,"end":298},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":321,"end":326},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":355,"end":359},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":393,"end":398},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":524,"end":528},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":670,"end":674},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":778,"end":783},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":848,"end":853},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":958,"end":963},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1115},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1132},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1142},"obj":"P00519"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1248},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1253,"end":1257},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1463,"end":1468},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1595,"end":1600},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1605,"end":1609},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1658,"end":1661},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1715,"end":1718},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1715,"end":1718},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1748,"end":1753},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1758,"end":1762},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1811,"end":1814},"obj":"Q04206"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1811,"end":1814},"obj":"P21579"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1898,"end":1903},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":2029,"end":2034},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":2148,"end":2152},"obj":"P55316"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":2286,"end":2291},"obj":"Q9BZS1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
