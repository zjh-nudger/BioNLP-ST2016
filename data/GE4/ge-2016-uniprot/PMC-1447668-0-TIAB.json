Herein we describe downstream signaling pathways targeted by Foxp3 that may negatively impact retroviral pathogenesis. Overexpression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T and purified CD4+ T cells resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent decrease in basal levels of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal forkhead (FKH) domain, critical for nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity, abrogated the ability of Foxp3 to suppress NF-\u03baB activity in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat or primary human CD4+ T cells. We further demonstrate that Foxp3 suppressed the transcription of two human retroviral promoters (HIV-1 and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I [HTLV-I]) utilizing NF-\u03baB-dependent and NF-\u03baB-independent mechanisms. Examination of the latter identified the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) pathway as a target of Foxp3. Finally, comparison of the percent Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease. These results suggest an expanded role for Foxp3 in regulating NF-\u03baB- and CREB-dependent cellular and viral gene expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T8","span":{"begin":192,"end":197},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T9","span":{"begin":330,"end":335},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T10","span":{"begin":406,"end":411},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T11","span":{"begin":437,"end":440},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T12","span":{"begin":706,"end":711},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T13","span":{"begin":793,"end":796},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T14","span":{"begin":835,"end":840},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T15","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1104},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T16","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1104},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T17","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1104},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T18","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1104},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T19","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1104},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T20","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1104},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T21","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1110},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T22","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1110},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T23","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1110},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T24","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1110},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T26","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1110},"obj":"O43889"},{"id":"nfkb_T25","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1110},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T27","span":{"begin":1135,"end":1140},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T28","span":{"begin":1177,"end":1182},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T29","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1186},"obj":"P01730"},{"id":"nfkb_T30","span":{"begin":1187,"end":1191},"obj":"P01589"},{"id":"nfkb_T31","span":{"begin":1366,"end":1371},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T32","span":{"begin":1487,"end":1492},"obj":"Q9BZS1"},{"id":"nfkb_T35","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"obj":"P18848"},{"id":"nfkb_T34","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"obj":"Q02930"},{"id":"nfkb_T33","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"obj":"Q8TEY5"},{"id":"nfkb_T36","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"obj":"P16220"},{"id":"nfkb_T37","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"obj":"P15336"},{"id":"nfkb_T38","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"obj":"O43889"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
