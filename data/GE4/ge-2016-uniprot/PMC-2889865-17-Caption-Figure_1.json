Jurkat T-cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing the AP-1 cis-elements. (A) Time-dependent AP-1 activation in response to PMA. (B) HK E. coli does not activate AP-1. (C) Dose-dependent activation of AP-1 were performed using PMA alone (grey bars) and in combination with calcium ionophore (CaI 955 \u03bcM, black bars). (D) TCR-/- deficient cells responded to PMA (162 nM) by up-regulating AP-1 activity. Statistical significance from the control was determined using Student's t-test. (n = 4). Controls were arbitrarily set to 1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-uniprot","denotations":[{"id":"nfkb_T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T2","span":{"begin":108,"end":118},"obj":"P08659"},{"id":"nfkb_T3","span":{"begin":152,"end":156},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T4","span":{"begin":190,"end":194},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T5","span":{"begin":259,"end":263},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T6","span":{"begin":298,"end":302},"obj":"P05412"},{"id":"nfkb_T7","span":{"begin":484,"end":488},"obj":"P05412"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/"}]}
