The addition PTX to LPS-stimulated cells resulted in a reduction in TNF-\u03b1, similar to that observed in our previous experiments (529 pg/mL \u00b1 112 vs. 37 pg/mL \u00b1 10; P < 0.01). Pre-incubation of cells with H89 prior to LPS and PTX exposure did not result in any significant modulation of TNF-\u03b1 production when compared to that demonstrated with PTX alone (P = 0.2; Figure 5). These results suggest that downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 production by PTX in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells is, at least in part, PKA-independent.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
