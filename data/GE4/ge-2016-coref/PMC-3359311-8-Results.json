To determine whether CFTR dysfunction alters IL-1\u03b2 production, THP-1 cells and PBMCs from CF patients and healthy controls were treated with the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, prior to simulation with live P. aeruginosa. Treatment with CFTRinh172 did not alter IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 production in control subjects or CF patients (Fig. 8a\u2013b). Similarly, IL-1\u03b2 production was not different in monocyte-derived macrophages or THP-1 reporter cells treated with CFTRinh172 (Fig. 8c\u2013d). IL-8 (Fig. 8e) and NF-\u03baB activity (Fig. 8f) were also unchanged in CFTRinh172-treated THP-1 reporter cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
