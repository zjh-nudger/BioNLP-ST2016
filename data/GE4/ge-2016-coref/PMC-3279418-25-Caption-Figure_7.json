After 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with freshly isolated allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells (2.5\u00d7105 cells in 0.1 mL complete medium; MHC haplotype: H-2d). After 5 days, supernatants were collected and the secretion of IFN\u03b3, IL4, and IL2 were measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Samples from both negative controls had no detectable production of the aforementioned cytokines (not shown). Results are analyzed based on 2\u20134 mice per group. * P<0.05.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":480,"end":484},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":486,"end":489},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":495,"end":498},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":749,"end":777},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
