PCR was done in the linear range of amplification (determined for each primer pair-cDNA combination). Standard PCR reactions were performed with 1 \u00b5l of the cDNA solution, 50 \u00b5M of each primer solution, 10 mM of each dNTP, 25 mM MgCl2, 10X Goldstar DNA polymerase reaction buffer, and 0.5 units of Goldstar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). First PCR cycle consisted of 1 min at 92\u00b0C, 1 min at 58\u00b0C and 1 min at 72\u00b0C; then each PCR cycle consisted of 40 sec at 92\u00b0C, 40 sec at 58\u00b0C and 50 sec at 72\u00b0C. cDNA for \u03b2-actin was amplified for 28 cycles using the oligos: sense 5\u2032-GGCATCGTGATGGACTCCG-3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGA-3\u2032. cDNA for TNF-\u03b1 was amplified for 35 cycles using the oligos: sense 5\u2032-AAGCCTGTAGCCCATGTTGT-3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032-CAGATAGATGGGCTCATACC-3\u2032. cDNA for ICAM-1 was amplified for 35 cycles using the oligos sense 5\u2032-GTAGCAGCCGCAGTCATAATGG-3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032-A TGCTGTTGTATCTGACTGAGG-3\u2032.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
