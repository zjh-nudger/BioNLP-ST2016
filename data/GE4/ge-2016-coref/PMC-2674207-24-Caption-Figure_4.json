(B) GR isolated from FP (10\u22128 M) stimulated cells enhances GR\u2013importin-\u03b1 binding in the presence (\u2022) and absence (\u25aa) of activated GATA-3. * p<0.05 compared to no activated GR. (C) GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated cells does not attenuate GR\u2013importin-\u03b1 association. *p<0.05 compared to control. (D) Activated GR blocks the ability of purified phospho-GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated cells interacting with immobilised importin-\u03b1 in an in vitro binding assay. *p<0.05 compared to GATA-3 isolated from unstimulated cells. #p<0.05 compared to stimulated GATA-3-importin binding. (E) The effect of activated (\u2022) versus unstimulated (\u25cb) GR on attenuation of GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association was concentration-dependent. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 between groups.
