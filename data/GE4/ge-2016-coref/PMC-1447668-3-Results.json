Unlike full-length Foxp3, which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence-specific manner to forkhead binding sites, the \u0394FKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus cannot interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [16]. Therefore, we utilized the \u0394FKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization (or other function associated with the FKH domain) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-\u03baB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus. Overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not of \u0394FKH, was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF-\u03baB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells (Figure 2B). Both Foxp3 and \u0394FKH were expressed at very high levels following transfection as detected by real-time RT-PCR (unpublished data). These data appear to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is critically important for Foxp3 to down-regulate NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription. However, NF-\u03baB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full-length Foxp3 and \u0394FKH in Jurkat T cells (Figure 2C) and primary human CD4+ T cells (Figure 2D). Western blot analysis of NF-\u03baB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and \u0394FKH does not block NF-\u03baB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E). These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations. Alternative interpretations may include the possibility that the localization of \u0394FKH differ between epithelial cells and T cells. In either case, these results suggest a cell type-specific mechanism of action for this Foxp3 mutant.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":393,"end":398},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":400,"end":405},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T27","obj":"T5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
