FOXP3 is an essential transcription factor for natural, thymus-derived (nTreg) and inducible Treg (iTreg) commitment; however, the mechanisms regulating its expression are as yet unknown. We describe a mechanism controlling iTreg polarization, which is overruled by the Th2 differentiation pathway. We demonstrated that interleukin 4 (IL-4) present at the time of T cell priming inhibits FOXP3. This inhibitory mechanism was also confirmed in Th2 cells and in T cells of transgenic mice overexpressing GATA-3 in T cells, which are shown to be deficient in transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2\u2013mediated FOXP3 induction. This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of GATA3 to the FOXP3 promoter, which represses its transactivation process. Therefore, this study provides a new understanding of tolerance development, controlled by a type 2 immune response. IL-4 treatment in mice reduces iTreg cell frequency, highlighting that therapeutic approaches that target IL-4 or GATA3 might provide new preventive strategies facilitating tolerance induction particularly in Th2-mediated diseases, such as allergy.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":336,"end":341},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":489,"end":492},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":879,"end":888},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":953,"end":968},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T17","obj":"T25"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
