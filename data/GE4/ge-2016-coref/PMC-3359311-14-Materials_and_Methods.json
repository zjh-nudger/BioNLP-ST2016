Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Thermo Scientific). Lysates were resolved by electrophoreses on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight at 4\u00b0C for pro-IL-1\u03b2 (Santa Cruz), I\u03baB\u03b1 (Cell Signaling), or \u03b2-actin (Cell Signaling). Blots were subsequently probed with fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies, IRDye\u00ae 680 or 800CW (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 hour. Both blocking and probing steps were carried out in tris-buffered saline (G Biosciences) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% TWEEN 20 (Calbiochem). Blots were imaged on a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) and quantified using the included analysis software.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
