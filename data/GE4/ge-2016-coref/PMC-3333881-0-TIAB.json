Mechanisms underlying the NF-\u03baB deregulation by HIV-1 are relevant for immune dysfunction in AIDS. We report that in single round HIV-1 infection, or single-pulse PMA stimulation, the HIV-1 Tat transactivator activated NF-\u03baB by hijacking the inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 and by preventing the repressor binding to the NF-\u03baB complex. Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB and increased the p65 DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity. The arginine- and cysteine-rich domains of Tat were required for I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF-\u03baB activity. Among an array of NF-\u03baB-responsive genes, Tat mostly activated the MIP-1\u03b1 expression in a p65-dependent manner, and bound to the MIP-1\u03b1 NF-\u03baB enhancer thus promoting the recruitment of p65 with displacement of I\u03baB-\u03b1; similar findings were obtained for the NF-\u03baB-responsive genes CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2. Our results support a novel mechanism of NF-\u03baB activation via physical interaction of Tat with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV-1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":490,"end":495},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":514,"end":527},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T25","obj":"T5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
