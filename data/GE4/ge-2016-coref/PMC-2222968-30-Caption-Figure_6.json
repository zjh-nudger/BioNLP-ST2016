After 5 d, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (A) and results of six independent experiments are shown in the bar graph below (B). Statistical significance (one-way Anova, Newman-Keuls) is indicated by asterisks (**p \u2264 0.01, ***p \u2264 0.001). (C) Kinetic analysis of intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining is shown in panel C following exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to anti-CD3/28, IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2. Data are representative of three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
