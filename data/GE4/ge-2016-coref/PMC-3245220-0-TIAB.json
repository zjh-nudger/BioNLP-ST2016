The transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) is a key regulator of genes involved in M-CSF-induced mononuclear phagocyte survival and this study focused at identifying the mechanism of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation. Here, we demonstrate that M-CSF stimulated NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. The general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro-31-8220, the conventional PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor G\u00f6-6976, overexpression of dominant negative PKC\u03b1 constructs and PKC\u03b1 siRNA reduced NF-\u03baB activity in response to M-CSF. Interestingly, Ro-31-8220 reduced Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-\u03baBp65 leading to decreased M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. In this report, we identify conventional PKCs, including PKC\u03b1 as important upstream kinases for M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation, NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression, NF-\u03baB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation, and macrophage survival. Lastly, we find that NF-\u03baB p65 Ser276 plays an important role in basal and M-CSF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation in human mononuclear phagocytes.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
