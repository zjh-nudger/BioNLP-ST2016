(A) In absence of Tat, I\u03baB-\u03b1 occupies the NF-\u03baB enhancer of the MIP-1\u03b1 promoter and likely interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as HDACs (65), to inhibit gene transcription. (B) Tat activates the MIP-1\u03b1 expression by removing the I\u03baB-\u03b1 repressor from the NF-\u03baB enhancer, and by increasing the binding of p65 NF-\u03baB complex to the NF-\u03baB enhancer.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
