We found that stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with heat-killed PAO1 produced the highest levels of NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activation (Fig. 6a) and this correlated with IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) but negligible amounts of IL-1\u03b2 were secreted (Fig. 6c). Stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with live PAO1 did not significantly increase NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity (Fig. 6a) or IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) over priming alone. However, IL-1\u03b2 production was greatly augmented over primed cells stimulated with heat-killed PAO1 or unprimed cells stimulated with live PAO1 (Fig. 6c). This confirmed that NF-\u03baB activation alone is not sufficient for maximal IL-1\u03b2 secretion, but increased priming of NF-\u03baB is capable of augmenting IL-1\u03b2 production and secretion upon inflammasome stimulation. Dependency of these responses on NF-\u03baB was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition of NF-\u03baB using the Bay11-7082 inhibitor of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, which significantly reduced NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activation (P<0.001) (Fig. 6d) and the subsequent production of IL-8 (P<0.01) (Fig. 6e) and IL-1\u03b2 (P<0.001) (Fig. 6f) in response to both heat-killed and live PAO1. These results were also verified in CF and control PBMCs for each inflammasome examined (P<0.001) (Fig. 6g\u2013h). Overall these results confirm that NF-\u03baB is an important modulator of IL-1\u03b2 production and that increased activation of NF-\u03baB augments inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1\u03b2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1147},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1173,"end":1178},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T11","obj":"T22"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
