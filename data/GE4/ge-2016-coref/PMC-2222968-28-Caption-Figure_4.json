The cells were harvested at different time points, and mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR for FOXP3 and GATA3 expression. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments.\n(B) Intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining is shown after exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to differentiating conditions as in part A of the figure. Data are representative of three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
