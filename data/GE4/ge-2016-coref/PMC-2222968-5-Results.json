It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3\u2013 cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells. However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3\u2013. In fact both populations showed similarly enhanced proliferation (Figure 6A). Furthermore the TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25\u2013FOXP3+ minority, since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3+ cells were not confined to the highly divided cells. CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-\u03b2\u2013treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-\u03b2 and IL-4.\nThe addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells (Figure 6B). In line with the previous findings, the IL-4\u2013producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations. Since FOXP3 is known to act as a repressor of cytokine expression [20], we therefore analyzed GATA3 and FOXP3 expression. The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4\u20138), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; Figure 6C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3.\nThese results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-\u03b2 signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1539,"end":1544},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1549,"end":1554},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1635,"end":1647},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T45","obj":"T37"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T45","obj":"T38"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
