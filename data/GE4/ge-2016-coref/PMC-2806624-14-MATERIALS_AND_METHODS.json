After a 24-h culture in serum-free conditions and stimuli as indicated in the figures, luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PMA/ionomycin was used to stimulate the cells, because the transfection was only transient and the luciferase assay required a strong and fast stimulation of the cells. To evaluate the effect of overexpression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 on FOXP3 protein levels, CD4+ T cells were preactivated with 2 \u00b5g/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free AIM-V medium in the presence of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche) for 12 h, and then transfected with the vector pEGFPN1 containing the RUNX1 or RUNX3 fragment using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems) and the program T-23. FOXP3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry after 48 h of culture in AIM-V medium containing 1 nmol/liter IL-2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
