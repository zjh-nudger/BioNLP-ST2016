In most cases, experiments were reproduced with each type of purified CD4+ T\u00a0cell population with similar results obtained. Splenic DCs were prepared as described (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), and sort purified CD11c+ cells were added to the T\u00a0cell culture. Purified DO11.10 CD4+ T\u00a0cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/ml) were cultured as before (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), in a total volume of 1 ml cRPMI medium in a 48-well plate, with splenic DCs (2 \u00d7 104 cells/ml), and varying amounts of OVA and of IL-12. APC-independent differentiation of naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells into Th1 and Th2 cells used stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and appropriate cytokine conditions, and control Th1 and Th2 cells were cultured as described before (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006). Culture conditions for Th17 cells were as described before (Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2006). Importantly, Th1 and Th2 cells could be differentiated in cRPMI or IMDM (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006; Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2006), but Th17 cells were only differentiated optimally in IMDM (Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2009). When indicated, U0126 or PD184352 (MEK inhibitors), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), CT99021 (GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor), or a similar amount of DMSO were present in the culture. More details of specific culture conditions are provided in Figures S6 and S7.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
