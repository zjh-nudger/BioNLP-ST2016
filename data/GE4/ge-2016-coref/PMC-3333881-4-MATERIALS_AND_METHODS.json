Briefly, aliquots (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells) were suspended in 0.3\u2009ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and subjected to a double electrical pulse (0.22\u2009V, 960\u2009\u00b5F) in the presence of annealed siRNA (200\u2009pmol); electroporated cells were washed and cultured in complete medium. RNA interference was performed with: siRNA Tat sense, CUGCUUGUACCAAUUGCUAUU and siRNA Tat antisense, UAGCAAUUGGUACAAGCAGUU; siRNA control sense, CUGCUUGUCACA AUUGCUAUU and siRNA control antisense, UAGCAAUUGUGACAAGCAGUU. RNA interference of p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 was performed with SMART pool siRNA p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL, USA).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
