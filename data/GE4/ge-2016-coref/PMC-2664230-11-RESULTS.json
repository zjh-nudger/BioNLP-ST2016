LPS stimulation caused a negligible increase in CREB phosphorylation when compared to control (Figure 4A). PTX alone caused a marked increase in CREB phosphorylation (P < 0.01 vs. HBSS). When LPS and PTX exposure occurred simultaneously, CREB phosphorylation was significantly higher than with LPS stimulation alone (543 \u00b1 92 vs. 100 \u00b1 0; P < 0.01). In addition, the amount of CREB phosphorylation seen with concomitant LPS and PTX treatment was less than that seen with PTX alone, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08).\nTo determine if CREB-DNA binding was affected by PTX in a manner similar to CREB phosphorylation, an EMSA was performed. Exposure of LPS-stimulated cells to PTX similarly increased CREB DNA-binding compared to LPS alone (Figure 4B).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
