Culture with high doses of antigen for 7 days gave rise to Th1 cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 upon restimulation (Constant et\u00a0al., 1995; Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), but not IL-10 (Figure\u00a0S1A available online). Culture with low antigen doses under the same conditions led to the differentiation of Th2 cells, which expressed both IL-4 and IL-10 upon restimulation (Figure\u00a0S1A). Culture of naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (Figure\u00a0S1B).\nTo investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12. At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-\u03b3 expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure\u00a01A). Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure\u00a01A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B). Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen. Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 and lost their\u00a0capacity to produce IL-2 (Figure\u00a01B). Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ T\u00a0cells at both high and\u00a0low antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells\u00a0is most likely not related to limited IL-2. Naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T\u00a0cells or Treg cells (Figure\u00a0S2). Although it has been suggested that TGF-\u03b2 can induce IL-10 in CD4+ T\u00a0cells (Kitani et\u00a0al., 2003; Schiott et\u00a0al., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown). In fact, neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 led to increased IL-10 production by both T\u00a0cell subsets (Figure\u00a0S3). Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-\u03b2 or on the presence of other T\u00a0cell types.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T89","span":{"begin":2333,"end":2343},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":2371,"end":2386},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":2920,"end":2941},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":2950,"end":2954},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":2958,"end":2963},"obj":"Antecedent"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T56","obj":"T89"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T57","obj":"T54"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T57","obj":"T55"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
