The first 1000\u2009bp upstream of the major TSS are shown in lower case, the first 800\u2009bp of the transcribed sequence are shown in upper case. Introns are removed, but their positions are indicated. Arrows refer to transcriptional start sites and their observed frequency is given by the numbers above. The primer binding sites for 5\u2032-RACE analysis and cloning of the luciferase reporter constructs are underlined and the names of the primers are annotated. Gray and black arrowheads define the regions designated E1 and E2 which were cloned into vector pGL3-Promoter and used as EMSA probes. The ATG start codon and the identified Sp1/Sp3 transcription factor binding site are shown in bold.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
