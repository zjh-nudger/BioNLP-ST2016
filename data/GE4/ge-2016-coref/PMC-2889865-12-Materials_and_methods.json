Briefly, Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with PMA (162 nM) for 1 h, centrifuged (1000 \u00d7 g, 8 min) and the supernatants were collected and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Following centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1 h aged media, where cells have been grown in, containing PMA. The same procedure was performed to collect media after 2 h and 6 h. The final collection of media was performed after 24 h.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
