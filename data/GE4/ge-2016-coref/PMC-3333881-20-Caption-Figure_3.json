(A) Schematic representation of wild-type and mutant Tat proteins. (B) HA-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (5\u2009\u00b5l) was incubated in presence or absence of FLAG-Tat, FLAG-Tat T,N(23,24)A, FLAG-Tat K(50,51)A, FLAG-Tat R(49\u201357)A or FLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A (10\u2009\u00b5l) using in vitro translated proteins. Wild-type and mutant Tat proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody; immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. (C) 35S-methionine-labeled p65 (5\u2009\u00b5l) was incubated with in vitro translated HA-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (5\u2009\u00b5l) in presence or absence of FLAG-Tat or FLAG-Tat R(49\u201357)A (5, 10 or 20\u2009\u00b5l). HA-I\u03baB-\u03b1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody; immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, or autoradiography (35S-Met-p65). Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (lane 1). (D) The p65 DNA binding activity was analysed by EMSA using in vitro translated proteins. 32P-labeled-NF-\u03baB double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with p65 (0.5\u2009\u00b5l) in presence or absence of HA-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (1\u2009\u00b5l), FLAG-Tat or FLAG-Tat R(49\u201357)A (5 and 10\u2009\u00b5l); competition of DNA binding was performed with 10\u2009- up to 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-\u03baB double-stranded oligonucleotide. DNA/protein complexes were run on 6% PAGE\u2013TBE and analysed by autoradiography. (E) p50\u2212/\u2212p65\u2212/\u2212MEFs (3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells) were transfected with p\u03baBLuc (0.5\u2009\u00b5g) and pSV-\u03b2-Gal (0.1\u2009\u00b5g) with or without pRc/CMV-p65 (0.5\u2009\u00b5g), pCMV4-HA-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (0.5\u2009\u00b5g), p3xFLAG-Tat or p3xFLAG-Tat R(49\u201357)A (0.5, 1 and 2\u2009\u00b5g). The luciferase activity was measured in cell extracts 48-h post-transfection and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Fold activation was calculated relative to transfection of the p\u03baBLuc plasmid alone. Values (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093) are shown. As control of protein expression, aliquots of cell extracts (20\u2009\u00b5g) were analysed by western blotting with anti-p65, anti-HA, anti-FLAG and anti-\u03b3-tubulin antibodies.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
