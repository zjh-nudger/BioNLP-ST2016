The cells were transfected for 18-24 hours, serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 \u00b5M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 100 ng/ml of M-CSF for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. (B) NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP along with empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-\u03baB p65 WT, NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A, or NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A. The cells were cultured for 24 hours and then serum starved for 4 hours. Cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are fold change over empty vector + pTAL-SEAP. (C) NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP with either empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-\u03baB p65 WT or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A. The cells were transfected for 24 hours and serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 \u00b5M of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNF\u03b1. The supernatant were collected after 2 hours of treatment and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are the fold change over empty vector + pNF-\u03baB-SEAP. Data shown are mean \u00b1 S.E.M for at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
