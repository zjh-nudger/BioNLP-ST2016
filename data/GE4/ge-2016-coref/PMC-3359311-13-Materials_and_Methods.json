Bronchial epithelial cells were rested or primed with LPS for 5 hours and stimulated with live P. aeruginosa PAO1 or ATP for the times indicated. PBMCs and THP-1 reporter cells were either rested or primed with LPS (Invivogen) or heat-killed PAO1 overnight (16 hours). The next day the cells were challenged with live PAO1, PAO1\u0394exsA, ATP (Invivogen), or Poly(dA:dT) (Sigma Aldrich) for the times indicated (see Fig. 1). For stimulations with Poly(dA:dT), lipofectamine LTX was used at a 1\u22361 (w\u2236v) ratio of \u00b5g of DNA to \u00b5l of lipofectamine and was mixed 30 minutes prior to stimulation. The NF-\u03baB inhibitor Bay11-7082 (Invivogen) was added to cultures 1 hour prior to priming. If no priming was involved, inhibitor was added 1 hour prior to inflammasome stimulation. The CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh172 (Sigma Aldrich) was added to cultures 18 hours prior to inflammasome stimulation. The caspase-1 inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk (Biovision) was added to cultures 1 hour prior to inflammasome stimulation. Supernatants were collected and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Cytokines released into supernatants from PBMCs stimulated with inflammasome activators were quantified using sandwich ELISA (eBioscience).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
