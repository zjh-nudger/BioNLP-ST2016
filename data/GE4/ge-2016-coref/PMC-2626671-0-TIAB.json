CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes. We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) \u03b3 expression, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate a critical role for the transcription factor Runx3 in CTL differentiation. Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-\u03b3, perforin, and granzyme B. Our data point to the existence of an elaborate transcriptional network in which Runx3 initially induces and then cooperates with T-box transcription factors to regulate gene transcription in differentiating CTLs.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":500,"end":505},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":528,"end":540},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":550,"end":577},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":827,"end":849},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":879,"end":884},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":886,"end":894},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":900,"end":910},"obj":"Antecedent"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T15","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T15","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R4","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R5","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T13"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
