The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by flow cytometry and was \u226595%. Cells were stimulated with the following combination of mAbs to T cell surface molecules (Meiler et al., 2008): anti-CD2 (clone 4B2 and 6G4; 0.5 \u00b5g/ml), anti-CD3 (clone OKT3; 0.5 \u00b5g/ml), and anti-CD28 mAb (clone B7G5; 0.5 \u00b5g/ml; all from Sanquin) and cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium (Life Technologies) with the addition of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche). TGF-\u03b2 (R&D Systems) was used at 5 ng/ml, if not stated otherwise. A combination of PMA (25 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was used.\nHuman CD4+ CD127\u2212 CD25high and CD4+ CD127+ CD25neg cells were purified by flow cytometry using anti-CD127, anti\u2013CD25-PC5 (Beckman Coulter), and anti\u2013CD4-FITC antibodies (Dako).\nMouse naive (CD62Lhi44lo25\u2212) CD4+ T cells were purified by flow cytometry and activated in vitro with 5 \u00b5g/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1 \u00b5g/ml soluble anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience) in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Neutralizing anti\u2013IFN-\u03b3 and anti\u2013IL-4 mAbs (BD) were used at 1 \u00b5g/ml concentrations when indicated.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
