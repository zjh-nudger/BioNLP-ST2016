IL-4 and IL-13 regulate the expression of IgE from B lymphocytes, whereas IL-5 plays a key role in eosinophilic inflammation [1]. Th2 cytokines are regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-3, which is predominantly expressed in Th2 cells [2],[3]. GATA-3 determines Th2 cell differentiation and selectively activates the promoters of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 through chromatin remodelling [4]\u2013[7]. The key role of GATA-3 in allergic airway inflammation has been demonstrated in mice by the reduced release of Th2 cytokines in animals treated with dominant-negative mutants of GATA-3 and by local application of antisense oligonucleotides to GATA-3 [8],[9]. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of the Gata3 gene in mice reduces expression of Th2 cytokines in vitro and in vivo [10], and similar results have been reported in isolated murine CD4+ lymphocytes [11]. Finally, knockdown of GATA-3 expression using siRNA in human T cells results in loss of anti-CD3/CD28-mediated Th2 cytokine expression [12].\nIn order for GATA-3 to regulate gene expression, it must translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to access its target genes. Enhanced nuclear expression of GATA-3 following T cell receptor activation was first demonstrated in murine T cells [13] and was recently confirmed in human T cells following T cell receptor and co-receptor stimulation [12]. GATA-3 contains a classical nuclear import signal [14] and is transported into the nucleus by the nuclear import protein importin-\u03b1 (also known as karyopherin-\u03b1) [12]. Deletion of a region encompassing the GATA-3 nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) region in murine and human cells prevents its nuclear localisation [12],[14]. The affinity of the importin-\u03b1\u2013NLS interaction is regulated by phosphorylation [15], and we have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a critical role in phosphorylating GATA-3 to enhance its interaction with importin-\u03b1 and subsequent transport into the nucleus [12].\nCorticosteroids are highly effective in the treatment of allergic inflammation, with marked suppression of Th2 cytokines in airways of patients with asthma [16]. Corticosteroids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of steroid-sensitive genes. Alternatively, activated GR interacts with coactivator molecules to suppress the expression of inflammatory genes by inhibiting the action of proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) through the recruitment of co-repressor molecules such as histone deacetylase-2 [17],[18].\nNuclear localisation and retention of GR is mediated through the nuclear localisation sequences NL1 and NL2 [19], by nuclear retention signals [20], and by control of nuclear export via a chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM-1) dependent pathway [21]. NL1, which is similar to the SV40 NLS, binds to importin-\u03b1 [22]. NL1 is activated both by glucocorticoid agonists such as dexamethasone and fluticasone propionate (FP) and by glucocorticoid antagonists such as mifepristone (RU486) [23]. NL1 can be mutated, and the resulting GR still translocates to the nucleus in response to ligands, but via interaction with importin 7, an event that requires an as-yet unknown component [23]. NL2 is poorly defined, residing in the ligand-binding domain, and much less is known about its mechanism of GR import [24]. A variety of other factors are also important for the regulation of GR activation and nuclear import including chaperones such as Hsp90 and other immunophilins [24]\u2013[26] and FK506-binding proteins that may be linked to dynein and/or peptidylprolyl isomerase [27],[28].\nHowever, the molecular basis for the inhibition of Th2 cytokines by corticosteroids is not well understood, because the genes encoding IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 do not have any recognisable GRE sequence [29] and are only partly regulated by NF-\u03baB in human cells [30]\u2013[32]. Using overexpression and CAT-reporter genes, Lavender and colleagues [33] have shown that GR reduced GATA-3-mediated IL-5 and -13 promoter activity in human CD4+ T cells. The authors postulated that local recruitment of GR may alter the ability of GATA-3 either to bind to its target site, to cause transcriptional up-regulation, or to maintain an environment that is permissive for transcription.\nWe therefore investigated the effects of a synthetic corticosteroid, FP, on GATA-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in a T lymphocyte cell line (HuT-78) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro. We also studied the effects of inhaled fluticasone therapy on GATA-3 subcellular localization in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with asthma.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":389,"end":395},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":397,"end":402},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1223},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1253,"end":1255},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1319,"end":1322},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2082,"end":2088},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2100,"end":2103},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2417,"end":2441},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":2449,"end":2454},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":2449,"end":2454},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":2493,"end":2497},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T47","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T48","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T49","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R4","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T50","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R5","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T51","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R6","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T52","obj":"T51"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
