(B) Western blot analysis showing that FP (10\u22128 M) does not affect whole-cell GATA-3 degradation over 17 h. (C) GFP-tagged GATA-3 is overexpressed and cells stimulated (b\u2013j) or not (a) with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of treating cells with FP (10\u22128 M, f\u2013j) after 30 min stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 is also shown. (D) FP (10\u22128 M) does not prevent anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated p65 nuclear translocation at 60 min after stimulation. **p<0.01 compared to unstimulated cells. All results are representative of at least four independent experiments and are shown as mean\u00b1SEM. Results were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
