To detect the Tat protein, we produced HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R\u2212E\u2212 virions, which were used in single-round infection of U937, a human monocytic cell line. Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF-\u03baB activation following viral infection. The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3- to 12-h post-infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 6A).\nThe NF-\u03baB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat-negative cells (siRNA Tat), and increased at 12\u2009h only in Tat-positive cells (Figure 6B). Degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 was observed at 3-h post-infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of I\u03baB-\u03b1 at 12\u2009h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6C). Consistently, the IKK activity was induced at 3-h post-infection and turned off at 12\u2009h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6D). These results agreed with the kinetic of NF-\u03baB activation in single-round HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells (Figure 1), and further supported the requirement of viral expression to counteract the post-activation turn off of NF-\u03baB.\nIn HIV-1-infected U937 cells, the endogenous Tat was coimmunoprecipitated with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65 (Figure 6E), and activated the MIP-1\u03b1 expression in a p65-dependent manner, as shown by the lack of effect following RNA interference of Tat or p65 (Figure 6F). Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF-\u03baB enhancer of MIP-1\u03b1, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat (Figure 6G and H). Altogether these results indicated that in single round HIV-1 infection Tat associated with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65, and induced the p65-dependent activation of MIP-1\u03b1 expression through occupancy of the MIP-1\u03b1 promoter and increased recruitment of p65.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":629,"end":639},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":704,"end":706},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":1638,"end":1647},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1721,"end":1727},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T43","obj":"T54"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T44","obj":"T64"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
