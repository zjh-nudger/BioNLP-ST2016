Very low levels of TNF-\u03b1 were induced in PBM after stimulation with native CGN (Fig. 2A). Addition of 0.1 mg/ml 10 kDa dCGN resulted in approximately a 60-fold increase in TNF-\u03b1 production by PBM. This was a dose-dependent effect that reached a 180-fold increase when cells were exposed to 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (Fig. 2A). A 250-fold increase in TNF-\u03b1 production was detected at 1 mg/ml 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 2A). TNF-\u03b1 production increased in time reaching a maximum level at 8 hours of culture (Figure 2B). After 24 h, the amount of secreted TNF-\u03b1 was still one third of the total TNF-\u03b1. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known activator of immune cells also induced TNF-\u03b1 production with similar kinetics as dCGN (Fig. 2B). However, the amount of TNF-\u03b1 produced by LPS was 4-fold less than the one produced by dCGN and it was not detected after 8 hours of culture (Fig. 2B). Similarly, monocytic THP-1 cells cultivated in the presence of variable concentration of dCGN showed an increase in TNF-\u03b1 production (Fig. 2C). This increase in TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly smaller (about 10-fold) than the one presented by PBM (Fig. 2A). No TNF-\u03b1 was released from THP-1 cells exposed to native CGN (not shown). TNF-\u03b1 production by THP-1 cells was not dose dependent to the amount of dCGN used. Also there was no difference between the two forms (10 and 40 kDa) of dCGN (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 release from THP-1 cells stimulated with dCGN reached a maximum level at 32 h, while stimulation with LPS reached a maximum level at 56 h (Fig. 2D).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":339,"end":347},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":438,"end":444},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":956,"end":961},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":999,"end":1006},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T17","obj":"T10"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
