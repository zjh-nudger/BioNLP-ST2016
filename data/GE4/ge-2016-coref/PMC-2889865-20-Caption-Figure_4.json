Jurkat T-cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing either NF-\u03baB or AP-1 cis-acting elements. The cells were incubated with NF-\u03baB activation inhibitor (NAI) for 1 h followed by stimulation with PMA (162 nM, A and C) or HK E. coli (5 \u00d7 107 CFU/ml, B and D) for 24 h. (A, B) NF-\u03baB, but not (C, D) AP-1 was inhibited. Statistical significance from the positive control (PMA/HK E. coli) was determined using Student's t-test. (n = 4). Controls were set to 1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
