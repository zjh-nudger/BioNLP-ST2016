(B) Time course of the effect of FP (10\u22128 M) on phosphorylation of activated transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), a measure of p38 MAPK activity. (C) FP-induced inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is associated with the decrease of anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation\u2013induced serine phosphorylation (P-Ser) of GATA-3. For (A\u2013C), quantification of the densitometry data is also shown. Each bar represents mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to \u03b1CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) FP induced MKP-1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments and where appropriate expressed as means\u00b1SEM, *p<0.05. (E) FP induces MKP-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Results are representative of two independent experiments. All data except (E) were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
