Five different Silencer or Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX1 (Applied Biosystems) and three Silencer Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX3 (Applied Biosystems) were tested, and the best was selected for all further experiments. The Silencer Negative Control #1 siRNA (Applied Biosystems) was used for normalization. Cells were then left unstimulated or were stimulated after 12 h with anti-CD2, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28. Cells were cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium with the addition of 1 nmol/l IL-2 (Roche). Cells were harvested for mRNA detection of the target genes after 24 h and for protein detection after 48 h.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
