Cell culture supernatants were assayed for (A) NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity, (B) IL-8, and (C) IL-1\u03b2 secretion (n\u200a=\u200a3\u20136 experiments). Using the same stimulation method, THP-1 reporter cells were treated with Bay11-7082 (20 \u00b5M) for 1 hour prior to priming with heat-killed PAO1 or live PAO1. Supernatants were assayed at 24 hours for (D) NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity, (E) IL-8, and (F) IL-1\u03b2 secretion (n\u200a=\u200a3\u20135). PBMCs from CF patients (n\u200a=\u200a11\u201315) and controls (n\u200a=\u200a10\u201313) were treated with z-YVAD-fmk (20 \u00b5M) or Bay11-7082 (10 \u00b5M) and stimulated with live PAO1 (MOI\u200a=\u200a1), ATP (5 mM), or Poly(dA:dT) (1 \u00b5g/ml) according to the schedule in Figure 1. (G) IL-1\u03b2 and (H) IL-8 levels were measured at 24 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using two way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. *, **, and *** signify P<0.05, 0.01, and 0.001.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
