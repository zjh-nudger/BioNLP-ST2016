(A) IFN-\u03b3 expression by WT (Tbx21+/+) and T-bet\u2013deficient (Tbx21\u2212/\u2212) T cells. Naive CD8+ T cells, or cells activated and cultured for 4 or 6 d, were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 6 h, and IFN-\u03b3 expression was assessed by intracellular staining. Numbers show the percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ cells. (B) Northern blot analysis of Prf1 and GzmB mRNA expression in WT or T-bet\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells activated and either left uninfected (uninf) or transduced with retroviruses expressing Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP). Total cellular RNA was analyzed on day 6 of culture. The frequency of transduced cells in the cultures was equivalent for both constructs (\u223c65\u201370% GFP+ cells; not depicted). (C) Granzyme B and IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tbx21+/+ and Tbx21\u2212/\u2212 T cells analyzed in restimulated cells that had been cultured for 5 d. (D) IFN-\u03b3 production by cells transduced with Eo-VP16 or control (GFP) retroviruses (RV) measured on day 4 after 6 h of restimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Numbers show the percentage of GFP+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells. Results are representative of three (A and C) or two (B and D) independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
