To confirm the role of PKC\u03b1 in NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages, constructs for either wildtype (WT)-PKC\u03b1 or kinase-deficient (KD)-PKC\u03b1 was co-transfected with the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter gene and SEAP secretion was measured. As shown in Figure 7A, MDMs co-transfected with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP and WT-PKC\u03b1 had a 1.8-fold increase in NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared with NS cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.05), similar to M-CSF-treated cells expressing only pNF-\u03baB-SEAP. Transfecting human macrophages with the KD-PKC\u03b1 construct significantly reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity compared to WT-PKC\u03b1 transfected cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.016). Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells transfected with WT-PKC\u03b1 had 2.5-fold more NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared to unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells (NS) transfected with WT-PKC\u03b1 (Figure 7B). Expression of the KD-PKC\u03b1 construct into RAW 264.7 cells reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity to 1.5-fold (p\u200a=\u200a0.045) compared to cells transfected with WT PKC\u03b1.\nCell survival was also examined in MDMs expressing either WT-PKC\u03b1 or KD-PKC\u03b1 constructs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining. As expected, M-CSF increased MDM survival as measured by the percent of Annexin V/PI negative cells. Similarly, expression of WT-PKC\u03b1 protected cells from apoptosis. In contrast, expression of KD-PKC\u03b1 decreased M-CSF-induced cell survival (p<0.01) (Figure 7C).\nNext, we examined the effect of expressing the PKC\u03b1 constructs on NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKC\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-\u03baB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276. Expression of WT-PKC\u03b1 did not effect the phosphorylation of either residue with or without M-CSF stimulation. These observations demonstrate that PKC\u03b1 is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-\u03baB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65.\nTo further validate the impact that PKC\u03b1 played in M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKC\u03b1 siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells. A pool of specific PKC\u03b1 siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF. Reducing native PKC\u03b1 expression decreased M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in both MDM (Figure 7E) (p\u200a=\u200a0.012) and Raw 264.7 cells (Figure 7F) (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKC\u03b1 siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKC\u03b1 siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p\u200a=\u200a0.047). In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKC\u03b1 siRNA transfection decreased PKC\u03b1 protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that PKC\u03b1 regulated NF-\u03baB activation and M-CSF-regulated cell survival.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":1891,"end":1897},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":1950,"end":1956},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2018,"end":2032},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T36","obj":"T56"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T36","obj":"T59"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
