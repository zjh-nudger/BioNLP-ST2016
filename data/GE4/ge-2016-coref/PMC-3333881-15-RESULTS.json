To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Tat, FLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A or FLAG-Tat R(49\u201357)A, and 48\u2009h later the expression of a number of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes was analysed by real-time PCR. Tat significantly increased the expression of MIP-1\u03b1, CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while the mutants Tat C(22,25,27)A and Tat R(49\u201357)A were ineffective (Figure 5A\u2013E). The Tat-dependent transactivation of the NF-\u03baB-dependent genes was abolished when cells were transfected with siRNA p65, indicating that the Tat transcriptional activation was mediated by p65 (Figure 5A\u2013E). Differently, the expression of the NF-\u03baB-independent genes GAPDH and ACTB was unaffected by wild-type and Tat mutants (Figure 5F and G). These results were consistent with the requirement of both the cysteine-rich and arginine-rich domains of Tat to enhance the NF-\u03baB activity, suggesting that the up-regulation of NF-\u03baB-responsive genes by Tat might occur through physical interaction of the viral protein with p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1.\nMIP-1\u03b1, which was the mostly activated gene by Tat, encodes for a chemokine that promotes the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells (56). Consistently with our findings, MIP-1\u03b1 expression was increased in glial cells and lymph nodes of AIDS patients (57,58); moreover, MIP-1\u03b1 production was induced by HIV-1 infection (59,60) and Tat protein (57,61,62). The transcriptional regulation of MIP-1\u03b1 has been poorly characterized. Jaspar-based analysis (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) predicted three putative NF-\u03baB enhancers in the proximal promoter region of the MIP-1\u03b1 gene: NF-\u03baB1, \u22121023/\u22121014 nucleotides; NF-\u03baB2, \u2212661/\u2212652 nucleotides; NF-\u03baB3, +370/+379 nucleotides (Supplementary Figure S3A). To validate the predicted NF-\u03baB binding sites of the MIP-1\u03b1 promoter, we stimulated HeLa cells with TNF-\u03b1, a well-known NF-\u03baB inducer, and measured the expression levels of MIP-1\u03b1 by real-time PCR, and the p65 occupancy of the NF-\u03baB sites by ChIP. TNF-\u03b1 activated the expression of MIP-1\u03b1 and induced the p65 recruitment to the NF-\u03baB1 site of MIP-1\u03b1 without affecting the occupancy of the putative NF-\u03baB2 and NF-\u03baB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C). Tat also promoted the recruitment of p65 to the NF-\u03baB1 site of MIP-1\u03b1, while it did not affect the putative NF-\u03baB2 and NF-\u03baB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3D). Altogether these results indicated that the NF-\u03baB1 site was the only effective NF-\u03baB enhancer of the MIP-1\u03b1 promoter in response to TNF-\u03b1 and Tat.\nSimilarly to MIP-1\u03b1, Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-\u03baB enhancers of CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while it was ineffective at the promoters of GAPDH and ACTB (Figure 5H). By ChIP, Tat bound to the NF-\u03baB-responsive promoters, and not to the GAPDH and ACTB promoters, with loss of binding following p65 RNA interference (Figure 5I), suggesting that Tat occupancy occurred via p65 interaction. As additional findings, I\u03baB-\u03b1 was chromatin-immunoprecipitated at the NF-\u03baB enhancers in absence of Tat, and it was significantly removed in presence of Tat, or following I\u03baB-\u03b1 RNA interference (Figure 5J), indicating that Tat displaced I\u03baB-\u03b1 from promoters.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":526,"end":537},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":538,"end":554},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":559,"end":572},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1153,"end":1156},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1218},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1239,"end":1245},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":1247,"end":1252},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":2389,"end":2392},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":2466,"end":2468},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2717,"end":2720},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":2814,"end":2816},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T109","span":{"begin":2894,"end":2899},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":2989,"end":2996},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T70","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T70","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T71","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R4","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T72","obj":"T28"},{"id":"R5","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T73","obj":"T43"},{"id":"R6","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T74","obj":"T50"},{"id":"R7","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T75","obj":"T109"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
