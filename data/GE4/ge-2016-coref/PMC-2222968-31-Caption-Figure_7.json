GFP-positive cells were gated and analyzed for intracellular FOXP3 expression following a 2-d incubation period (lower panel). Data are representative of four independent experiments.\n(B) CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells were isolated from D011.10 and D011.10xCD2-GATA3 mice and treated with OVA and TGF-\u03b2 for 96 h. Surface CD4 and intracellular FOXP3 were measured by FACS. These data are representative of three independent experiments.\n(C) The cells treated as in (B) were harvested and mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR for SMAD7 and TGF-\u03b2 expression. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
