RPS3 harbors a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence and its nuclear translocation occurs in parallel to, but independently of, p65 translocation6. We envisioned that RPS3 could also utilize the importin-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway. Consistent with this notion, RPS3 association with importin-\u03b1, but not importin-\u03b2, was enhanced in TNF\u2013stimulated cells (Fig. 3a). Therefore, we examined whether RPS3 binding to importin-\u03b1 is essential for nuclear translocation during NF-\u03baB activation.\nSince I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation is a prerequisite to unmask the NLS of p65, and both RPS3 and I\u03baB\u03b1 bind to p65 in the cytoplasmic inhibitory complex, we tested whether I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation is required for the liberation of RPS3. We measured the association of RPS3 with importin-\u03b1 in 293T cells overexpressing wild-type I\u03baB\u03b1 or an I\u03baB\u03b1 mutant (SSAA) resistant to IKK\u03b2-induced phosphorylation and degradation. In cells transfected with wild-type I\u03baB\u03b1, TNF stimulation augmented the interaction of RPS3 and importin-\u03b1 to a similar degree as in non-transfected cells. By contrast, we observed that the RPS3-importin-\u03b1 association was abolished by the presence of non-degradable I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig. 3b).\nTo examine whether I\u03baB\u03b1 is the only cytoplasmic barrier precluding RPS3 nuclear translocation, we measured both RPS3-importin-\u03b1 association and nuclear RPS3 after reducing I\u03baB\u03b1 expression. Compared with nonspecific siRNA, siRNA targeting of I\u03baB\u03b1 completely depleted I\u03baB\u03b1 in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3c, input). Nevertheless, the RPS3-importin-\u03b1 association was not augmented (Fig. 3c), nor was significant nuclear RPS3 detected (Fig. 3d). Moreover, cells treated with sodium pervanadate (Pv) to induce I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation through an IKK-independent mechanism25-27 did not show increased association between RPS3 and importin-\u03b1 (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3b) or nuclear accumulation of RPS3, despite complete I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation (Supplementary Fig. 3c). We further examined whether a subsequent NF-\u03baB activation signal independently promotes the importin-\u03b1 association and nuclear transport of RPS3 after I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. We found that TNF stimulation following Pv treatment was required for the RPS3-importin-\u03b1 association, comparable to TNF stimulation alone (Fig. 3e). Thus, I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation itself is required but not sufficient to cause RPS3 association with importin-\u03b1 followed by nuclear translocation. Rather, an additional signal, potentially IKK\u03b2 phosphorylation of RPS3, is required.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":117,"end":121},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":179,"end":182},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T45","obj":"T4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
