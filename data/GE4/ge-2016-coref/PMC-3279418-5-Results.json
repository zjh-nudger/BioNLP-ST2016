Flow cytometric analysis shows that the expression levels of CD14 and TLR4/MD2 between WT and cpdm BMDC were similar (Fig. 5A). We then quantified the secretion of the suppressive cytokines IL10 that can inhibit IL12 secretion in an autocrine manner [20], [21]. The supernatants from LPS-stimulated cpdm BMDC contained significantly lower levels of IL10 than stimulated WT BMDC (Fig. 5B), suggesting that IL10 was not responsible for decreased secretion of IL12P70 by cpdm BMDC. Increased expression of a negative regulator of TLR signaling such as A20 [22] may also suppress cytokine secretion. However, the transcript level of A20 was lower in LPS-activated cpdm BMDC than WT controls (Fig. 5C), thereby ruling out overexpression of A20 as a factor in the reduced cytokine production.\nThe transcription of TLR3/4-induced proinflammatory intermediates is tightly regulated by cellular signaling pathways, in particular NF-\u03baB, TBK1/IRF3, and MAPK [23]\u2013[27]. We next determined if disrupted NF-\u03baB, TBK1/IRF3, and/or MAPK signaling may underlie the impaired cytokine production from stimulated Sharpin-deficient BMDC. Stimulus-induced phosphorylation of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK1/2) is an essential step in NF-\u03baB signaling, allowing phosphorylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 to release the NF-\u03baB transcription factors into the nucleus. The amount of phosphorylated IKK1/2 (p-IKK1/2) and I\u03baB\u03b1 (p-I\u03baB\u03b1) following incubation with LPS or poly I:C was severely decreased in cpdm BMDC as compared with WT controls (Fig. 6). The cpdm BMDC exhibited similar levels of TBK1, ERK1/2, and p38 phosphorylation to those of WT cells (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the absence of functional SHARPIN decreased NF-\u03baB activation but did not affect TBK1/IRF3, ERK1/2, and p38 signaling in BMDC.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
