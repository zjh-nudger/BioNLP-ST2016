Both 10 kDa and 40 kDa dCGN induced a robust increase in mRNA for both ICAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 6). \u03b2-actin mRNA levels were not affected by dCGN treatment.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":92,"end":98},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":114,"end":119},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":188,"end":203},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T8","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T8","obj":"T4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
