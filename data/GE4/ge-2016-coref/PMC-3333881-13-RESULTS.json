For mapping the interaction domains, we used the following Tat mutants: Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat C(22,25,27)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49\u201357)A (Figure 3A). I\u03baB-\u03b1 coimmunoprecipitated with all Tat proteins, except Tat R(49\u201357)A (Figure 3B). These results indicated that the arginine-rich domain of Tat was involved in the binding to I\u03baB-\u03b1, which was consistent with previous observations (50,51). Moreover, Tat associating with I\u03baB-\u03b1 competed the binding of I\u03baB-\u03b1 to p65 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C, lanes 3\u20135), while Tat R(49\u201357)A, which lacked the binding site for I\u03baB-\u03b1, did not associate with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and did not compete the binding of I\u03baB-\u03b1 to p65 (Figure 3C, lanes 6\u20138).\nNext, we evaluated whether Tat counteracted the I\u03baB-\u03b1-mediated inhibition of p65 binding to DNA by incubating in vitro translated p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 proteins with the NF-\u03baB probe in presence or absence of Tat followed by EMSA. The p65 DNA binding activity was inhibited by I\u03baB-\u03b1 and restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49\u201357) (Figure 3D). Further, we analysed the Tat effect on the I\u03baB-\u03b1 repression of p65 transcriptional activity by transfecting p50\u2212/\u2212p65\u2212/\u2212MEFs with the NF-\u03baB-Luc reporter together with expression vectors of p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1, in presence or absence of Tat. I\u03baB-\u03b1 inhibited the p65-dependent expression of the luciferase gene, which was restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49\u201357)A (Figure 3E). Altogether these results indicated that Tat counteracts the I\u03baB-\u03b1 repression of the p65 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity by associating with I\u03baB-\u03b1 and competing the repressor binding to p65.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":20,"end":25},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":57,"end":70},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":1818,"end":1823},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":1838,"end":1851},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T54","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T55","obj":"T52"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
