The cytokine profile revealed an enhanced induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-6, TNF and the chemokine CXCL8. The levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were unaffected by PMA but were significantly decreased by HK E. coli (Table 1). These results confirmed that PMA and HK E. coli induced an inflammatory response in the Jurkat T-cells. It is interesting to note that PMA was 120-fold more effective at inducing CXCL8 than HK E. coli. PMA-dependent induction of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-\u03baB suggests an involvement of AP-1 in CXCL8 regulation. Determination of the time course of cytokine induction in response to PMA showed that CXCL8 was already released between 2-6 h, while TNF and IL-6 were released between 6-24 h (figure 3). These results indicated that the cytokines were differentially regulated and that the release was not associated with the early transient induction of NF-\u03baB. The temporal induction of AP-1 correlated to the CXCL8 levels and preceded the TNF and IL-6 release. This suggests an association between CXCL8 release and AP-1 signalling.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":859,"end":864},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":915,"end":919},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":990,"end":1003},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T12","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T12","obj":"T8"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
