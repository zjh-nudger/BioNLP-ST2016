As expected (17, 21), naive Tbx21\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 poorly upon activation (Fig. 2 A). Notably, this deleterious effect of T-bet deficiency was only observed in differentiating CD8+ T cells until day 4 of culture but was almost completely mitigated by day 6 (Fig. 2 A). This most likely reflected compensation by Eomes, which was strongly induced between days 4 and 6 (Fig. 1). In contrast, T-bet\u2013deficient T cells cultured for 6 d showed no defect in perforin mRNA expression (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 4). We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T-bet\u2013deficient T cells (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 4), which did not translate into a decrease in expression of granzyme B protein (Fig. 2 C).\nTo examine the role of Eomes, we transduced naive CD8+ T cells from WT and Tbx21\u2212/\u2212 mice with retroviruses containing internal ribosome entry site (IRES)\u2013GFP that were either empty or encoded a strongly transactivating version of Eomes (Eo-VP16) (8), and expanded them for 6 d under our culture conditions. Eo-VP16, but not the empty GFP retrovirus, increased perforin expression in both WT and T-bet\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). As expected, Eo-VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN-\u03b3 production observed in T-bet\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2 D). However, Eo-VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T-bet\u2013deficient cells; thus, the partial T-bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo-VP16.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":583,"end":588},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":590,"end":595},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T42","obj":"T15"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
