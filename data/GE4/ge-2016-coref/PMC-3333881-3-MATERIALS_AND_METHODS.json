PBMCs were isolated as previously described (53). Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2\u2009mM l-glutamine (Lonza Cologne AG, Germany). HeLa, p50\u2212/\u2212p65\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and 293T were transfected with DNA by using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol; total DNA amounts were equalized by transfection of pRc/CMV empty vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For pulse-stimulation, HeLa cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) (20\u2009ng/ml) for 5\u2009min, or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1; Sigma-Aldrich) (20\u2009ng/ml) for 30\u2009min, washed twice in complete culture medium and then returned to culture. For luciferase assays, pSV-\u03b2-Gal was co-transfected with p\u03baBluc to monitor the transfection efficiency. Forty-eight-hour post-transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer of Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix, Bedford, MA, USA) and the luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities were evaluated by using Dual Light Luciferase System (Tropix) in a bioluminometer (Turner Biosystem, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to \u03b2-galactosidase activity was expressed as relative light units.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
