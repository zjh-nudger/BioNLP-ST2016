During RNA purification, genomic DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (Amersham Biosciences). Next, 0.5 \u00b5g of total RNA was reversed transcribed using the avian myeloblastosis virus RT (Promega, Southampton, UK). For relative quantification, RT-PCR was carried out using cDNA probes. Primers for IL-4 were from Sigma-Genosys (Cambridge, UK). Sequences of GADPH used are as follows: forward 5\u2032-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGC, reverse 3\u2032-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCAC.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
