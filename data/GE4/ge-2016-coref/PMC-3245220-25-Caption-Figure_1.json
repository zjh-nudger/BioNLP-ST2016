NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity was analyzed by EMSA Shown is a representative blot from three independent experiments. NS: non-stimulated. (B) Human MDMs transiently transfected with pTAL-SEAP or pNF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs were treated with M-CSF in X-vivo medium and incubated for 6 hours before the collection of medium. NF-\u03baB activity was analyzed by measuring the amount of SEAP secreted into the medium and data are expressed as fold increase of SEAP activity over that in pTAL-SEAP transfected resting cells. (C) RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with pTAL-SEAP or pNF-\u03baB-SEAP construct. Cells were serum starved for 4 hours prior to 2 hours stimulation with mouse recombinant M-CSF (100 ng/ml). Culture media was collected to measure SEAP production. Data are expressed mean \u00b1 S.E.M, for three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
