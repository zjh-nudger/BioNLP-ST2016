In MDMs pretreated with PKC inhibitors (Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976, or BAPTA/AM) and stimulated with M-CSF, cleaved caspase-3 was elevated to levels of cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 3A). In contrast, cells incubated with M-CSF and vehicle had less cleaved caspase-3 than cells incubated with vehicle alone or M-CSF with PKC inhibitors. These data supported the hypothesis that M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity was regulated by conventional PKCs, not novel PKCs.\nTo confirm that PKC inhibition decreased cell survival, cells were treated with M-CSF in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitors and then also examined for apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining. PKC inhibitors in the presence of M-CSF reduced the number of Annexin V/PI negative MDMs compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 3B). These observations further suggested that MDM survival is promoted by M-CSF and critically involves conventional PKCs and NF-\u03baB activity.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
