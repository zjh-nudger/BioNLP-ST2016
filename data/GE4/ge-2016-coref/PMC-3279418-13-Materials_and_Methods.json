Allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice by negative selection kit (Invitrogen) and were then added at 2.5\u00d7105 and co-cultured with activated BMDC. After 5 days, supernatant was collected and the secretion of IFN\u03b3, IL4, IL2, and IL17A measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Both negative controls show no production of aforementioned cytokines.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":428,"end":432},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":434,"end":437},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":439,"end":442},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":448,"end":453},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":676,"end":700},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T5","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T5","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
