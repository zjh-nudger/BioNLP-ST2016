Cytoplasmic I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation was markedly increased following LPS stimulation when compared to control (100 \u00b1 0 vs. 20 \u00b1 18; P < 0.05). The addition of PTX significantly downregulated LPS-induced I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation (P = 0.02; Figure 2)\nIn a similar fashion, nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation was increased following LPS stimulation (100 \u00b1 0 vs. 38 \u00b1 20; P < 0.01). PTX similarly decreased LPS-induced NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear phosphorylation, a marker of NF-\u03baB activation and nuclear translocation (100 \u00b1 0 vs. 40 \u00b1 6; P =0.03; Figure 3A).\nEMSAs were then performed to verify the PTX-induced alterations in nuclear phosphorylation resulted in similar effects on the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. The addition of PTX to LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells resulted in comparable downregulation of DNA binding activity, similar to the observed downregulation of NF-\u03baB phosphorylation (Figure 3B).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
