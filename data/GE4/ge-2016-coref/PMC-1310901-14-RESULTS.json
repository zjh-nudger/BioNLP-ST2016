To this end, we did not detect a significant difference in DNMT (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B) or MBP (MBD1, MBD2, MBD4 and MeCP) mRNA expression between IRF-4-positive and -negative cells (Figure 5D). In fact, all analyzed cells had moderate to high mRNA levels of these tested DNMT/MBPs and differences in expression were not correlated with IRF-4 status. These results indicate a distinct cause of the methylation differences in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells rather than changes in the DNMT and MBP mRNA transcription.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":420,"end":425},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":427,"end":433},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":438,"end":444},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":454,"end":458},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":460,"end":464},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":466,"end":470},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":475,"end":479},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":617,"end":634},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":635,"end":639},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":841,"end":849},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":854,"end":857},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T13","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T15","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R14","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T13","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T13","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T14","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T14","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T14","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T14","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T15","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T15","obj":"T4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
