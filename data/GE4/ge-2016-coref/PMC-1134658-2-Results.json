All experiments in this study were performed under serum-free conditions as FCS has been shown to interfere with BMP-signalling [14](own observations). To study the effect of BMP-6 on proliferation, B-cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated with anti-IgM and/or CD40L in the presence or absence of BMP-6 for three days. We found that BMP-6 led to a 35% mean reduction of anti-IgM- induced DNA synthesis (n = 8; p \u2264 0.0002, Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained for B cells treated with anti-IgM and CD40L (26% mean reduction, n = 6; p \u2264 0.023). The BMP-6-induced inhibition of proliferation was dose-dependent in both peripheral B cells (Figure 1B) and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos (40% reduction of DNA synthesis, Figure 1C). The BMP-6 effects could be reversed by addition of the extracellular inhibitor Noggin (Figure 1D). Similarly, a combination of the soluble BMP receptors BMP-RIB-Fc and BMP-RII-Fc also neutralized the effects of BMP-6 (data not shown). Next, we wanted to test whether BMP-6 had different effect on na\u00efve and memory B cells. Na\u00efve (CD19+CD27-) and memory (CD19+CD27+) B cells were isolated from peripheral blood by cell sorting of immunobead-isolated CD19+ B cells [15], and tested for their capacity to proliferate in the presence of BMP-6. However, BMP-6 inhibited anti-IgM induced DNA synthesis in the two subpopulations to a similar extent, with a mean reduction of DNA-synthesis of 45% (n = 5; p \u2264 0,004) for na\u00efve B cells and 48% (n = 5; p \u2264 0,001) for memory B cells (Figure 1E).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
