In addition, because of the number of conventional PKCs existing within mononuclear cells, pharmacological inhibitors of PKC family activation was used to determine the relationship of PKC activation to M-CSF-induced cellular survival. MDMs were transfected with the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter and then treated with the general PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220; the conventional PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor G\u00f6-6976; or the intracellular calcium blocker BAPTA/AM. Ro-31-8220 significantly suppressed M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 2A). In addition, G\u00f6-6976 and BAPTA/AM also blocked NF-\u03baB activity in M-CSF-treated MDMs. Trypan blue exclusion analysis did not indicate cell death suggesting that this suppression was not due to non-specific toxicity. These data indicate that M-CSF mediated NF-\u03baB activation through calcium-dependent conventional PKC activation.\nWe next investigated whether PKC inhibition affected NF-\u03baB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Similar to MDMs, PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976 and BAPTA/AM reduced M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Figure 2B). To ensure that PKC specifically regulated NF-\u03baB p65 and not the closely related family member, c-Rel, we co-transfected c-Rel and NF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs into the Raw 264.7 cell line and measured NF-\u03baB activity in response to M-CSF. There was no increased NF-\u03baB activity in cells expressing c-Rel (Figure S1). These observations indicate that PKC functioned upstream of NF-\u03baB p65 in MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
