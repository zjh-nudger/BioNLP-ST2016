Briefly, human monocytes (5\u00d7106) were incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium and restimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF overnight. The cells were removed from the culture dish using Accutase (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and stained with Annexin V\u2013FITC and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD PharMingen). Annexin V-FITC and PI double negative cells were considered non-apoptotic cells for statistical analysis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
