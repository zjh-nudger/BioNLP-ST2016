This concentration is close to peak plasma levels obtained from asthmatic patients treated with inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) [27]. Inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) treatment of seven steroid-naive asthma patients significantly reduced GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 interaction in vivo in a time-dependent manner. This produced a >90% decrease in GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association at 2 h (median [95% CI], 13,494 [6,828\u201317,829] versus 879 [597\u20131,165]; p<0.05 Friedman's analysis). However, this did not reach significance using Wilcoxon's post-test analysis (W\u200a=\u200a6.00) probably due to low numbers of participants. Similar results were observed when GATA-3\u2013importin-\u03b1 association was measured (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower dose of FP (100 \u00b5g) was not effective. The attenuated interaction of GATA-3 did not result from the defective recycling of importin-\u03b1, as a significant decrease in the abundance of importin-\u03b1 in the cytoplasmic pool was not detected (Figure 6E).\nWe further examined whether inhaled FP could affect cellular localization of GATA-3 in peripheral blood T cells. Treatment with inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) for 2 h significantly increased GR nuclear translocation (Figure 7A) and concomitantly decreased the number of nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactive peripheral blood T cells (37%\u00b14.2% versus 58.2%\u00b14.95%, p\u200a=\u200a0.016, W\u200a=\u200a28.0, Wilcoxon's rank test) compared with placebo as measured by immunocytochemistry (Figure 7A and 7B). This was confirmed by Western blotting, which also indicated that this effect was both time- and dose-dependent (Figure 7C and 7D). Thus, inhaled FP (500 \u00b5g) induced significant loss in nuclear GATA-3 at 2 h (median [95% CI], 0.40 [0.27\u20130.53] versus 0.14 [0.11\u20130.19], p<0.05, W\u200a=\u200a21.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7C) and cytoplasmic GATA-3 levels were enhanced by inhaled FP in a dose-dependent manner (median [95% CI], 0.0032 [0.0026\u20130.0039] versus 0.658 [0.592\u20130.720], p<0.05, W\u200a=\u200a\u221221.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7D). In addition, FP (500 \u00b5g) inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation in primary T cells in vivo at 2 h in samples from two patients (Figure 7E).\nTaken together, our data suggest that inhaled FP reduces nuclear localization of GATA-3 in vivo by acutely inhibiting phospho-GATA-3\u2013importin association. This effect may be direct, through competition for importin-\u03b1 or associated molecules, or secondary to an effect on p38 MAPK-mediated GATA-3 phosphorylation via rapid induction of MKP-1. The combination of these two interacting effects can result in complete suppression of GATA-3 nuclear import and thus Th2 cytokine gene expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
