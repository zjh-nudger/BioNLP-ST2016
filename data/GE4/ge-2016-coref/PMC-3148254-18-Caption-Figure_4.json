Cells were activated with CD154-expressing insect cells for the times indicated. As a negative control, cells were stimulated with insect cells lacking CD154 (5 minute time point only). Western blots of whole-cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies. Phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 (pI\u03baB\u03b1) and phospho-JNK (pJNK) blots were stripped and reprobed for total I\u03baB\u03b1 and total JNK, respectively (anti-JNK antibodies recognize p46 and p54 isoforms). I\u03baB\u03b1 blots were also reprobed for actin to demonstrate equal lane loading. Molecular weights are indicated at right. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment and in two additional experiments with a second HOIP-deficient clone.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
