Unstained cells serve as negative controls. (B) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (1\u00d7105 cells in 0.1 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with medium, 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 \u00b5g/ml poly I:C for 24 hours. Supernatants were collected for ELISA of IL10. (C) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (5\u00d7105 cells in 0.2 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 \u00b5g/ml poly I:C. At 0, 1, and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the production of A20.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
