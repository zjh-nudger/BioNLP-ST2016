Among the I\u03baB molecules, I\u03baB\u03b1 is highly induced by NF-\u03baB activation [40]. Having shown that PKC regulated NF-\u03baB activity in M-CSF-stimulated MDMs, we next determined whether inhibition of PKC activity decreased expression of NF-\u03baB-regulated genes. We treated both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes and then stimulated with M-CSF. I\u03baB\u03b1 gene was measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, M-CSF enhanced I\u03baB\u03b1 gene expression and PKC inhibition by Ro-31-8220 decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 gene expression in both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells (p<0.01), demonstrating that PKC affected NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression in macrophages.\nTo further define the role of PKC in mediating human MDM survival in response to M-CSF, we examined the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-xL, which is also regulated by NF-\u03baB. As shown in Figure 6C, Ro-31-8220 reduced M-CSF-stimulated BCL-xL expression compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle control DMSO (p<0.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":898,"end":921},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":922,"end":928},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":930,"end":935},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
