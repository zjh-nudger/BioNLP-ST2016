HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27), p3xFLAG-Tat R(49\u201357) or empty vector (10\u2009\u00b5g); for p65 RNA interference, cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g) and siRNA p65 or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol). Twenty-four-hour post-transfection, total RNA was extracted and analysed by real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of MIP-1\u03b1 (A), CSF3 (B), LTA (C), NFKBIA (D), TLR2 (E), GAPDH (F), ACTB (G) genes. (H) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, or empty vector (10\u2009\u00b5g) and 48\u2009h later ChIP was performed with anti-p65 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (I) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with empty vector, or p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g) in presence or absence of siRNA p65, or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol); 48\u2009h later, ChIP was performed with anti-FLAG antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (J) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with empty vector, p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g), or empty vector plus siRNA I\u03baB-\u03b1 or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol); 48\u2009h later, ChIP was performed with anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. Values (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093) are shown. The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control (empty vector) according to the Student's t-test (P\u2009<\u20090.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
