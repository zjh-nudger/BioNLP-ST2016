To confirm the role of PKC and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected the NF-\u03baB-SEAP construct with either WT NF-\u03baB p65 or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A constructs in Raw 264.7 cells, then treated cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presences of M-CSF. As expected in cells transfected with vector control, inhibiting PKC reduced M-CSF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle DMSO (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) (Figure 8A). In contrast, expressing WT NF-\u03baB p65 (p65 WT) increased NF-\u03baB activity, while the general PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 decreased this NF-\u03baB activity (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Notably, the introduction of NF-\u03baB p65 276 S/A construct significantly reduced NF-\u03baB activity compared with the WT NF-\u03baB p65 construct (p\u200a=\u200a0.005) and M-CSF treatment was unable to overcome this inhibition.\nFurthermore, we co-transfected the NF-\u03baB-SEAP construct along with either the WT NF-\u03baB p65, NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A or NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A constructs into a NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 murine fibroblast cell line and measured NF-\u03baB activity. As predicted, expression of WT NF-\u03baB p65 (p65 WT) in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line constitutively activated NF-\u03baB compared to cells transfected with vector control without any stimulation (Figure 8B). In comparison, transfecting the NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A construct reduced NF-\u03baB activity by 5-fold (p\u200a=\u200a0.006, WT NF-\u03baB p65 vs. NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A), while expressing the NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A construct increased NF-\u03baB activity in the p65\u2212/\u2212 cells to levels similar to WT NF-\u03baB p65 transfected cells.\nSince M-CSF-induced PKC activation regulated NF-\u03baB activity via Ser276 residue of NF-\u03baB p65 in primary human MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells, we next examined if this occurred in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts in response to a native stimulus for these cells, TNF\u03b1. NF-\u03baB activity was measured in the WT NF-\u03baB p65 or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A transfected cells treated with TNF\u03b1 in the absence or presence of Ro-31-8220 (Figure 8C). As expected, TNF\u03b1 increased NF-\u03baB activity in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing WT p65 and (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) PKC inhibitors decreased NF-\u03baB activity to the non-stimulated (NS) level (p\u200a=\u200a0.007). Introducing NF-\u03baB p65 276 S/A constructs significantly reduced NF-\u03baB activity compared with the WT NF-\u03baB p65 construct (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Notably, TNF\u03b1 failed to increase NF-\u03baB activity in the NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A constructs. These observations are similar to macrophages overexpressing the NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A (Figure 8A). Our data demonstrate that Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65 is essential in regulating NF-\u03baB activity and suggests that PKC regulates NF-\u03baB activity by modulating the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 at Ser276 residue.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
