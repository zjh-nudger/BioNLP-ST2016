Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) is a key inflammatory mediator. Secretion of biologically active IL-1\u03b2 involves inflammasome-mediated processing. Little is known about the contribution of IL-1\u03b2 and the inflammasomes in CF inflammatory disease. This study examines inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 production in CF bronchial epithelial cell lines and human patients with CF.\nResults\nBronchial epithelial cell lines were found to produce negligible amounts of basal or stimulated IL-1\u03b2 compared to hematopoeitic cells and they did not significantly upregulate caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both CF and healthy control subjects produced large amounts of IL-1\u03b2 and strongly upregulated caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. PBMCs from CF patients and controls displayed similar levels of caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production when stimulated with inflammasome activators. This IL-1\u03b2 production was dependent on NF-\u03baB activity and could be enhanced by priming with LPS. Finally, chemical inhibition of CFTR activity in control PBMCs and THP-1 cells did not significantly alter IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 production in response to P. aeruginosa.\nConclusion\nHematopoeitic cells appear to be the predominant source of inflammasome-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 in CF. PBMCs derived from CF subjects display preserved inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to the major CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that increased IL-1\u03b2 production in CF subjects is due to an intrinsic increase in NF-\u03baB activity through loss of CFTR function.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
