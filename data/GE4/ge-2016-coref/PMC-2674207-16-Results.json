We therefore investigated whether corticosteroids affect anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated nuclear import of GATA-3. Stimulation of cells with anti-CD3/CD28 resulted in a rapid cytoplasmic/nuclear GATA-3 translocation (Figure 1A), confirming our previous results [12]. We also confirmed a clear separation of nuclear and cytosolic fractions as indicated by histone H1 and MEK-1 markers (Figure 1B). The potent topical corticosteroid FP caused sustained loss of nuclear GATA-3 expression and cytoplasmic retention of GATA-3 at concentrations ranging from 10\u221212 to 10\u22128 M, which cover the therapeutic range [37]. This effect was concentration- and time-dependent, with a peak effect of 11.6-fold at 30 min at a concentration of 10\u22128 M (Figure 1C) and was associated with marked reductions in anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression (Figure 1D) and a loss of GATA-3 binding to the native IL-5 promoter (Figure 1E).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
