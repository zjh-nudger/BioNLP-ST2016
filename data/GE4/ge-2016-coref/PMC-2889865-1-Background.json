T-cells produce a broad range of inflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-6, TNF and CXCL8, all of which are important in cell proliferation, differentiation, communication and initiation of inflammatory responses [2]. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8, are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis [3-5], pulmonary fibrosis [6,7] and AIDS [8,9]. Induction of CXCL8 has been suggested to be mediated through NF-\u03baB in cooperation with AP-1 [10,11], however the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, and treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting CXCL8 have failed [12]. Persistent production of IL-6 and CXCL8 leads to chronic inflammation and enhanced survival of lymphocytes increasing serum cytokine/chemokine levels. This forms the basis of several autoimmune disorders including plasmacytosis and hyperplasia [13]. To develop viable CXCL8 based treatment strategies, it is necessary to identify the signalling pathways regulating CXCL8 and determine how this is coupled to NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and IL-6.\nThe signalling pathways leading to NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activation are overlapping, where both are involved in the induction and regulation of cytokines/chemokines. NF-\u03baB is activated in response to stress, such as oxidative stress, bacterial toxins, viruses and UV light [14], and is essential for differentiation, proliferation and survival of many cell types including T-lymphocytes [15]. AP-1 activation requires Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) and Jun (c-Jun, v-Jun, JunB, JunD) through the formation of homo- and hetero-dimers [16,17], and regulates transcription of a broad range of genes involved in immune responses [18-21]. Both AP-1 and NF-\u03baB binding sites have been identified in the promoter region of IL-6 and CXCL8 [12,22], however, the mechanism by which these interleukins are regulated in T-cells is still not clear. CXCL8 is a C-X-C chemokine with properties enabling it to recruit T-cells and basophils and to activate neutrophils and monocytes [23]. IL-6 is a cytokine that possesses both pro- and anti-inflammatory characteristics and that plays a key role in haematopoiesis and acute-phase responses [24,25].\nThe present study suggests that the regulation of CXCL8 and IL-6 is uncoupled. Using Jurkat T-cells exposed to PMA and heat killed (HK) Escherichia coli MG1655 in combination with inhibitors of NF-\u03baB, JNK and PKC, we demonstrated that NF-\u03baB regulates IL-6 expression while the regulation of CXCL8 more closely correlated to AP-1 activity. These results indicate that inhibition of NF-\u03baB is not an effective strategy in countering the high CXCL8 activities in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, AIDS and pulmonary fibrosis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":148,"end":170},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":182,"end":186},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":192},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":202,"end":207},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1610,"end":1613},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1615,"end":1620},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1622,"end":1626},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1628,"end":1633},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1635,"end":1640},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1646,"end":1649},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1651,"end":1656},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1658,"end":1663},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1665,"end":1669},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1671,"end":1675},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1908,"end":1912},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1917,"end":1922},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1964,"end":1982},"obj":"Anaphor"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T31","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T33","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R11","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T33","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R12","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T34","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R13","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T34","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T31","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T31","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T32","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R5","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T32","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R6","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T32","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R7","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T32","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R8","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T33","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R9","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T33","obj":"T18"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
