Antigen expression was then analyzed by flow cytometry. A: Histograms of ICAM-1 expression in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). B: Fluorescence intensity for expression of the antigens HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD14, ICAM-1, and CD58 in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). Data are mean +/\u2212 SEM.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":447,"end":459},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":477,"end":481},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":483,"end":489},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":495,"end":499},"obj":"Antecedent"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T6","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
