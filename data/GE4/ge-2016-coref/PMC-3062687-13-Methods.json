The Flag-RPS3, GST-RPS3, HA-RPS3, VN-HA, NleH1-HA plasmids were described previously6, 9. The point mutants of RPS3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Kit (Stratagene) with primers forward 5\u2032-CTGCCTGACCACGTGGCCATTGTGGAACCCAAA-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-TTTGGGTTCCACAATGGCCACGTGGTCAGGCAG-3\u2032 for S209A. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
