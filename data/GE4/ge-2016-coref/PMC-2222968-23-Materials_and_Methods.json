The chromatin was sheared to 200-1000 bp of length by sonication with five pulses of 10 s at 30% power (Bandelin). The chromatin was pre-cleared for 2 h with normal mouse IgG beads and then incubated with anti-GATA3-agarose beads (HG3\u201331; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. Washing and elution buffers were used according to the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology. Crosslinks were reversed by incubation at 65 \u00b0C for 4 h in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl, and the DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. The amount of DNA was determined by conventional PCR. The PCR addressed for the FOXP3 promoter region \u2212246 to \u2212511 and was performed using the following primers: 5\u2032-gtgccctttacgagt catctg-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-gtgccctttacgagtcatctg-3\u2032. The PCR products were visualized using an ethidium bromide gel.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
