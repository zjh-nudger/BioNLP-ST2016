Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. Real-time RT PCR was performed using primers for I\u03baB\u03b1, BCL-xl or GAPDH. Data are expressed as relative fold increase of I\u03baB\u03b1 or BCL-xl gene expression upon treatment over non-stimulated cells. Data represent the mean \u00b1 S.E.M for three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
