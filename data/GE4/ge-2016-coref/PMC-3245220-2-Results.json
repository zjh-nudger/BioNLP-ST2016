Interestingly, adding M-CSF did not alter NF-\u03baB DNA binding by EMSA. In contrast, after transiently transfecting human MDMs with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs containing four NF-\u03baB consensus binding sequences, M-CSF treatment of the transfected cells resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in SEAP release in the culture media compared to PBS (vehicle)-treated transfected MDMs (Figure 1B). As a control, the pTAL-SEAP construct lacking NF-\u03baB binding sites was used. Cells transfected with the pTAL-SEAP construct did not produce SEAP in the absence or presence of M-CSF (Figure 1B).\nWe next investigated whether M-CSF induced NF-\u03baB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with either the NF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter or control pTAL-SEAP construct. As shown in Figure 1C, M-CSF treatment of RAW 264.7 cells increased NF-\u03baB reporter activity by 2.5-fold over that of non-treated cells. Together, our data demonstrate that M-CSF induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in macrophages.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
