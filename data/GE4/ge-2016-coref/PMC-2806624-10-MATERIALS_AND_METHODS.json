For Th1 differentiation conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-4, and 25 ng/ml IL-12 (R&D Systems). For Th2 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 25 ng/ml IL-4, and 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12 (R&D Systems). For T reg cell conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-4. For Th17 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 20 ng/ml IL-6, 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2, 20 ng/ml IL-23 (Alexis Biochemicals Corp.), 10 ng/ml IL-1\u03b2, 5 \u00b5g/ml anti-IL-4, and 5 \u00b5g/ml anti\u2013IL-12 were used. Proliferating cells were expanded in medium containing IL-2. The cytokine profile of these cells demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 is the predominant cytokine in Th1 cells, IL-4 and IL-13 in Th2 cells, and IL-17 in Th17 cells (Akdis et al., 2000; Burgler et al., 2009).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
