Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK 293T cells transfected with a control vector (EGFP) or Foxp3 expression vector (1,000 ng) in the presence or absence of forskolin (10 \u03bcM for 4 h) using the TransFactor Extraction Kit (BD Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using a Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclear extracts (20 \u03bcg) were incubated in preblocked wells containing plate-bound double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to an ATF/CREB consensus sequence (\u2026TGACATCA\u2026). Wells were washed, incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, washed, incubated with secondary antibody (HRP-labeled), washed again, and finally developed with TMB substrate. Colorimetric reactions were read using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at an absorbance of 655 nm.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
