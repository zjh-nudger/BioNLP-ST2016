The obtained splenic homogenates were centrifuged over a Percoll gradient (35% and 55% density) for 15 minutes. The bands at the 35%-medium and the 35\u201355% interface were pooled, washed and stained with a combination of various antibodies to stain different DC subsets, conventional CD11c+CD8\u03b1+, CD11c+CD8\u03b1\u2212 and plasmacytoid DC (CD11c\u2212PDCA-1+).The top panels were gated on FSChiSSClo cells to show separate populations of CD11c+PDCA-1\u2212 and CD11c\u2212PDCA-1+ cells. Further gating on the CD11c+PDCA-1\u2212 subpopulation gave the bottom panel that showed two distinct pools of CD11c+CD8\u03b1+ and CD11c+CD8\u03b1\u2212 cells. Percentages were calculated based on the parental population and were additionally shown as bar graphs (n\u200a=\u200a2) (B). (C) WT and cpdm BMDC (5\u00d7105) cells were stimulated with medium, 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 \u00b5g/ml poly I:C for 24 hours. The cells were labeled with PE-labeled anti-CD40, anti-CD80, and anti-CD86, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The populations shown in histograms were gated on CD11c+ cells. Unstained cells served as negative controls. Results are representative of two independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
