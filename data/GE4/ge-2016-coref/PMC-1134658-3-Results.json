Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining after culture with or without BMP-6 for 48 hours. Interestingly, BMP-6 showed a small, but reproducible mean increase of cell death from 17 to 23% (n = 5; p \u2264 0,003) in anti-IgM stimulated CD27+ memory B cells. Furthermore, Ramos cells showed a mean increase in cell death from 20 to 50% (n = 3, p < 0,001, figure 3) after BMP-6 treatment. In contrast, cell death of total CD19+ cells (n = 6; p \u2264 0,32; data not shown) or CD27-IgG- na\u00efve B cells was not significantly affected (n = 5; p \u2264 0,65, figure 2).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
