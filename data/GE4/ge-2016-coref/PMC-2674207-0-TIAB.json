Corticosteroids are highly effective in suppressing allergic inflammation, but their effects on GATA-3 are unknown. We investigated the effect of the corticosteroid fluticasone propionate on GATA-3 regulation in human T-lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo.\nMethods and Findings\nIn a T lymphocyte cell line (HuT-78) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in vitro we demonstrated that fluticasone inhibits nuclear translocation of GATA-3 and expression of Th2 cytokines via a mechanism independent of nuclear factor-\u03baB and is due, in part, to competition between GATA-3 and the ligand-activated glucocorticoid receptor for nuclear transport through the nuclear importer importin-\u03b1. In addition, fluticasone induces the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), the endogenous inhibitor of p38 MAPK, which is necessary for GATA-3 nuclear translocation. These inhibitory effects of fluticasone are rapid, potent, and prolonged. We also demonstrated that inhaled fluticasone inhibits GATA-3 nuclear translocation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with asthma in vivo.\nConclusions\nCorticosteroids have a potent inhibitory effect on GATA-3 via two interacting mechanisms that potently suppress Th2 cytokine expression. This novel mechanism of action of corticosteroids may account for the striking clinical efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic diseases.\nPlease see later in the article for Editors' Summary","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-coref","denotations":[{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":193,"end":206},"obj":"Anaphor"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":207,"end":225},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":227,"end":231},"obj":"Antecedent"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":237,"end":242},"obj":"Antecedent"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"boundBy","subj":"T16","obj":"T5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
