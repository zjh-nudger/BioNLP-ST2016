T4_Bacteria__Vibrio_fischeri , a bioluminescent marine bacterium , exists in an exclusive symbiotic relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid , Euprymna scolopes , whose T8_Habitat__light_organ it colonizes . 
Previously , it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or free lipid A of T9_Bacteria__V._fischeri can trigger morphological changes in the T10_Habitat__juvenile_squid light organ that occur upon colonization . 
Previously , it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or free lipid A of T9_Bacteria__V._fischeri can trigger morphological changes in the T11_Habitat__juvenile_squid's_light_organ that occur upon colonization . 
Given their unusual nature , it is possible that these features of the T14_Bacteria__V._fischeri lipid A may underlie the ability of T15_Habitat__E._scolopes to recognize its symbiotic partner .
