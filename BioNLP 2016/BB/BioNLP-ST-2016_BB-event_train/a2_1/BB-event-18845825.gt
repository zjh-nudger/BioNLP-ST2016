High genetic diversity of nontypeable T3_Bacteria__Haemophilus_influenzae isolates from two children attending a T5_Habitat__day_care_center . 
Twenty-one T6_Bacteria__nontypeable_Haemophilus_influenzae_(NTHi) isolates from the T7_Habitat__throats_of_two_healthy_children were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing . 
Twenty-one T6_Bacteria__nontypeable_Haemophilus_influenzae_(NTHi) isolates from the throats of two T8_Habitat__healthy_children were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing . 
These STs were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree of reported T9_Bacteria__NTHi STs , demonstrating the high level of NTHi diversity found in T11_Habitat__colonized_children . 
These STs were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree of reported NTHi STs , demonstrating the high level of T10_Bacteria__NTHi diversity found in T11_Habitat__colonized_children .
