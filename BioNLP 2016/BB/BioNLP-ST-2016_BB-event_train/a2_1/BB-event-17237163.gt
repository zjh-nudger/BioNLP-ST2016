T4_Bacteria__Serratia_marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen and a major cause of T5_Habitat__ocular infections . 
In previous studies of T6_Bacteria__S._marcescens_MG1 , we showed that T7_Habitat__biofilm maturation and sloughing were regulated by N-acyl homoserine lactone ( AHL ) - based quorum sensing ( QS ) . 
We concluded that T27_Bacteria__S._marcescens_MG1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to T28_Habitat__biotic_surfaces and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in adhesion to an abiotic surface but not in adhesion to a biotic surface . 
We concluded that T27_Bacteria__S._marcescens_MG1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to biotic and T29_Habitat__abiotic_surfaces and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in adhesion to an abiotic surface but not in adhesion to a biotic surface . 
We concluded that T27_Bacteria__S._marcescens_MG1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to biotic and abiotic surfaces and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in adhesion to an T30_Habitat__abiotic_surface but not in adhesion to a biotic surface . 
We concluded that T27_Bacteria__S._marcescens_MG1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to biotic and abiotic surfaces and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in adhesion to an abiotic surface but not in adhesion to a T31_Habitat__biotic_surface .
