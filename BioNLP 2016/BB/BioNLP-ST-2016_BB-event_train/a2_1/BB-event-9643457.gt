Flow cytometric measurement of T3_Habitat__neutrophil alkaline phosphatase before and during initiation of an induced T4_Bacteria__Escherichia_coli mastitis in cattle . 
Flow cytometric measurement of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase before and during initiation of an induced T4_Bacteria__Escherichia_coli mastitis in T5_Habitat__cattle . 
In 12 T6_Habitat__healthy_cows , neutrophil alkaline phosphatase ( NAP ) activity was measured by flow cytometer before and during an experimentally induced T8_Bacteria__Escherichia_coli mastitis , to study the role and increase of NAP in Gram - negative bacterial infections . 
In 12 healthy cows , T7_Habitat__neutrophil alkaline phosphatase ( NAP ) activity was measured by flow cytometer before and during an experimentally induced T8_Bacteria__Escherichia_coli mastitis , to study the role and increase of NAP in Gram - negative bacterial infections .
