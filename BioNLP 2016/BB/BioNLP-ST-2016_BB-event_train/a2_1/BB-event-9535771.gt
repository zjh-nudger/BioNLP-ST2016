Order of fusions between bacterial and T3_Habitat__mammalian proteins can determine solubility in T4_Bacteria__Escherichia_coli . 
We made fusions between T5_Bacteria__Escherichia_coli maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) and the T6_Habitat__mammalian aspartic proteinases pepsinogen or procathepsin D . 
MBP - pepsinogen , however , was efficiently renatured from 8 M urea in vitro , suggesting that the T8_Bacteria__E._coli cytoplasm does not support folding of the T9_Habitat__mammalian partner protein to the native state .
