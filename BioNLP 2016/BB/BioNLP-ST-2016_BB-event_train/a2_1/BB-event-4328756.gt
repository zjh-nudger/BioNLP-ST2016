Heat - killed T8_Bacteria__C._burnetii purified with T9_Habitat__normal_yolk_sacs demonstrated no activity after disruption . 
When cellulose acetate electrophoresis was performed on the extracts , aldolase from both T12_Habitat__normal_yolk_sacs exhibited five isozyme bands , whereas aldolase from the T15_Bacteria__C._burnetii extract appeared as a single band . 
When cellulose acetate electrophoresis was performed on the extracts , aldolase from both normal and T13_Habitat__infected_yolk_sacs exhibited five isozyme bands , whereas aldolase from the T15_Bacteria__C._burnetii extract appeared as a single band .
