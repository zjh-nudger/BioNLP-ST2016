Enhanced virulence of T3_Bacteria__Chlamydia_muridarum T4_Habitat__respiratory infections in the absence of TLR2 activation . 
T5_Bacteria__Chlamydia_trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted pathogen and is associated with T6_Habitat__infant pneumonia . 
Data from the T7_Habitat__female_mouse model of genital tract T9_Bacteria__chlamydia infection suggests a requirement for TLR2 - dependent signaling in the induction of inflammation and oviduct pathology . 
Data from the female mouse model of T8_Habitat__genital_tract T9_Bacteria__chlamydia infection suggests a requirement for TLR2 - dependent signaling in the induction of inflammation and oviduct pathology . 
Data from the female mouse model of genital tract T9_Bacteria__chlamydia infection suggests a requirement for TLR2 - dependent signaling in the induction of inflammation and T10_Habitat__oviduct pathology . 
In order to investigate this , we infected T12_Habitat__mice via the intranasal route with T14_Bacteria__C._muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation , mice had more severe disease , higher lung cytokine levels , and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs . 
In order to investigate this , we infected mice via the T13_Habitat__intranasal route with T14_Bacteria__C._muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation , mice had more severe disease , higher lung cytokine levels , and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs . 
In order to investigate this , we infected mice via the intranasal route with T14_Bacteria__C._muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation , T15_Habitat__mice had more severe disease , higher lung cytokine levels , and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs . 
In order to investigate this , we infected mice via the intranasal route with T14_Bacteria__C._muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation , mice had more severe disease , higher T16_Habitat__lung cytokine levels , and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs . 
In order to investigate this , we infected mice via the intranasal route with T14_Bacteria__C._muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation , mice had more severe disease , higher lung cytokine levels , and an exaggerated influx of T17_Habitat__neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs . 
In order to investigate this , we infected mice via the intranasal route with T14_Bacteria__C._muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation , mice had more severe disease , higher lung cytokine levels , and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T18_Habitat__T-cells into the lungs . 
In order to investigate this , we infected mice via the intranasal route with T14_Bacteria__C._muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation , mice had more severe disease , higher lung cytokine levels , and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T-cells into the T19_Habitat__lungs . 
These data suggest that TLR2 has an anti - inflammatory function in the T21_Habitat__lung during T22_Bacteria__Chlamydia infection , and that the role of TLR2 in mucosal inflammation varies at different mucosal surfaces . 
These data suggest that TLR2 has an anti - inflammatory function in the lung during T22_Bacteria__Chlamydia infection , and that the role of TLR2 in T23_Habitat__mucosal inflammation varies at different mucosal surfaces . 
These data suggest that TLR2 has an anti - inflammatory function in the lung during T22_Bacteria__Chlamydia infection , and that the role of TLR2 in mucosal inflammation varies at different T24_Habitat__mucosal_surfaces .
