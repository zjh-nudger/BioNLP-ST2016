Our previous study demonstrated that treatment of T4_Bacteria__Coxiella_burnetii with the phase I lipopolysaccharide ( PI - LPS ) - targeted monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) 1E4 significantly inhibited C. burnetii infection in T6_Habitat__mice , suggesting that 1E4 is a protective MAb .

To determine whether passive transfer of antibodies ( Abs ) can provide protection against T7_Bacteria__C._burnetii natural infection , we examined if passive transfer of 1E4 would protect T8_Habitat__SCID_mice against C. burnetii aerosol infection . 
To determine whether passive transfer of antibodies ( Abs ) can provide protection against T7_Bacteria__C._burnetii natural infection , we examined if passive transfer of 1E4 would protect SCID mice against C. burnetii T10_Habitat__aerosol infection . 
To determine whether passive transfer of antibodies ( Abs ) can provide protection against C. burnetii natural infection , we examined if passive transfer of 1E4 would protect T8_Habitat__SCID_mice against T9_Bacteria__C._burnetii aerosol infection . 
To determine whether passive transfer of antibodies ( Abs ) can provide protection against C. burnetii natural infection , we examined if passive transfer of 1E4 would protect SCID mice against T9_Bacteria__C._burnetii T10_Habitat__aerosol infection . 
The results indicated that 1E4 conferred significant protection against T11_Habitat__aerosolized T12_Bacteria__C._burnetii , suggesting that 1E4 may be useful for preventing C. burnetii natural infection . 
The results indicated that 1E4 conferred significant protection against T11_Habitat__aerosolized C. burnetii , suggesting that 1E4 may be useful for preventing T13_Bacteria__C._burnetii natural infection . 
To further understand the mechanisms of 1E4 - mediated protection and to test the possibility of using humanized 1E4 to prevent T14_Bacteria__C._burnetii infection , we examined whether the Fab fragment of 1E4 ( Fab1E4 ) , a recombinant T15_Habitat__murine single - chain variable fragment ( muscFv1E4 ) , and a humanized single - chain variable fragment ( huscFv1E4 ) retained the ability of 1E4 to inhibit C. burnetii infection .

The results indicated that Fab1E4 , muscFv1E4 , and huscFv1E4 were able to inhibit T17_Bacteria__C._burnetii infection in T18_Habitat__mice but that their ability to inhibit C. burnetii infection was lower than that of 1E4 . 
The results indicated that Fab1E4 , muscFv1E4 , and huscFv1E4 were able to inhibit C. burnetii infection in T18_Habitat__mice but that their ability to inhibit T19_Bacteria__C._burnetii infection was lower than that of 1E4 . 
In addition , treatment of T20_Bacteria__C._burnetii with Fab1E4 , muscFv1E4 , or huscFv1E4 can block C. burnetii infection of T22_Habitat__macrophages . 
In addition , treatment of C. burnetii with Fab1E4 , muscFv1E4 , or huscFv1E4 can block T21_Bacteria__C._burnetii infection of T22_Habitat__macrophages . 
Interestingly , treatment of T23_Bacteria__C._burnetii with huscFv1E4 can significantly reduce C. burnetii infectivity in T25_Habitat__human_macrophages . 
Interestingly , treatment of T23_Bacteria__C._burnetii with huscFv1E4 can significantly reduce C. burnetii infectivity in T26_Habitat__human macrophages . 
Interestingly , treatment of C. burnetii with huscFv1E4 can significantly reduce T24_Bacteria__C._burnetii infectivity in T25_Habitat__human_macrophages .
