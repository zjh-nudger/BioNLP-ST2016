Both cases were confirmed to have T18_Habitat__rectal T19_Bacteria__Chlamydia_trachomatis - specific DNA of an LGV associated serovar . 
A strong argument already exists for the incorporation of T20_Bacteria__chlamydia nucleic acid amplification tests in the management of T21_Habitat__MSM_with_proctitis ; this paper provides evidence that this should be extended to MSM with perianal ulcer disease .
