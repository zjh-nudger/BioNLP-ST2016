Recurrence of T6_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori infection 1 year after successful treatment : prospective cohort study in the T7_Geographical__Republic_of_Yemen . 
To investigate the prevalence of T8_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori infection in T9_Habitat__dyspeptic_patients in the Republic of Yemen and the recurrence rate 1 year after apparently successful eradication . 
To investigate the prevalence of T8_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori infection in dyspeptic patients in the T10_Geographical__Republic_of_Yemen and the recurrence rate 1 year after apparently successful eradication . 
T13_Habitat__Gastric_biopsies were obtained at endoscopy and T14_Bacteria__H._pylori infection was diagnosed using the rapid urease test . 
The prevalence of T21_Bacteria__H._pylori infection in T22_Habitat__dyspeptic_patients in Yemen is very high , the eradication rate with standard triple therapy was unsatisfactory probably because of widespread bacterial resistance due to unrestricted antibiotic use . 
The prevalence of T21_Bacteria__H._pylori infection in dyspeptic patients in T23_Geographical__Yemen is very high , the eradication rate with standard triple therapy was unsatisfactory probably because of widespread bacterial resistance due to unrestricted antibiotic use .
