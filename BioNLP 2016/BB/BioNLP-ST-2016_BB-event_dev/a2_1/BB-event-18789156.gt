A novel receptor - ligand pathway for entry of T5_Bacteria__Francisella_tularensis in T6_Habitat__monocyte-like_THP-1_cells : interaction between surface nucleolin and bacterial elongation factor Tu . 
T7_Bacteria__Francisella_tularensis , the causative agent of tularemia , is one of the most infectious T8_Habitat__human bacterial pathogens . 
We show here that T13_Habitat__cell - surface expressed nucleolin is a receptor for T14_Bacteria__Francisella_tularensis_Live_Vaccine_Strain ( LVS ) and promotes LVS binding and infection of human monocyte - like THP -1 cells .

The HB -19 pseudopeptide that binds specifically carboxy - terminal RGG domain of nucleolin inhibits T20_Bacteria__LVS binding and infection of T21_Habitat__monocyte-like_THP-1_cells . 
A specific polyclonal T23_Habitat__murine antibody was raised against recombinant T24_Bacteria__LVS EF - Tu . 
Anti - EF - Tu antibodies reduced T25_Bacteria__LVS binding to T26_Habitat__monocyte-like_THP-1_cells and impaired infection , even in absence of complement and complement receptors . 
Altogether , our results demonstrate that the interaction between surface nucleolin and its bacterial ligand EF - Tu plays an important role in T28_Bacteria__Francisella_tularensis adhesion and entry process and may therefore facilitate invasion of T29_Habitat__host_tissues . 
Since phagosomal escape and intra - cytosolic multiplication of T30_Bacteria__LVS in T31_Habitat__infected_monocytes are very similar to those of human pathogenic F. tularensis ssp tularensis , the mechanism of entry into monocyte - like THP -1 cells , involving interaction between EF - Tu and nucleolin , might be similar in the two subspecies .
