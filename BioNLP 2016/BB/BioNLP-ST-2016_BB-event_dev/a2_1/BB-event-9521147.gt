Lipopolysaccharide from nonvirulent T3_Bacteria__Ara+_Burkholderia_pseudomallei isolates is immunologically indistinguishable from lipopolysaccharide from virulent Ara - T5_Habitat__clinical isolates . 
Lipopolysaccharide from nonvirulent Ara+ Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates is immunologically indistinguishable from lipopolysaccharide from virulent T4_Bacteria__Ara- T5_Habitat__clinical isolates . 
Different lines of evidence suggest that a discrepancy between the distribution of T6_Bacteria__Burkholderia_pseudomallei in the environment and the distribution of the disease melioidosis is attributable , at least in part , to phenotypic differences between T8_Habitat__clinical and some environmental isolates . 
Different lines of evidence suggest that a discrepancy between the distribution of Burkholderia ( T7_Bacteria__Pseudomonas_pseudomallei in the environment and the distribution of the disease melioidosis is attributable , at least in part , to phenotypic differences between T8_Habitat__clinical and some environmental isolates . 
In this study , lipopolysaccharides ( LPSs ) were extracted by the proteinase K digestion method from a total of 214 T9_Bacteria__B._pseudomallei isolates , and their immunoreactivities with T10_Habitat__sera_from_patients_with_different_clinical_spectra_and_with_other_infections were evaluated .
