T3_Habitat__Bile resistance in T4_Bacteria__Lactococcus_lactis strains varies with cellular fatty acid composition : analysis by using different growth media . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of T6_Habitat__bile resistance in T7_Bacteria__lactococci by studying the relationship between bile resistance and cellular fatty acid composition in lactococcci grown on different media . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of bile resistance in T7_Bacteria__lactococci by studying the relationship between T8_Habitat__bile resistance and cellular fatty acid composition in lactococcci grown on different media . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of T6_Habitat__bile resistance in lactococci by studying the relationship between bile resistance and cellular fatty acid composition in T9_Bacteria__lactococcci grown on different media . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of bile resistance in lactococci by studying the relationship between T8_Habitat__bile resistance and cellular fatty acid composition in T9_Bacteria__lactococcci grown on different media . 
In T16_Bacteria__L._lactis_subsp._cremoris strains grown in T17_Habitat__GM17_medium , the bile - resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid than the bile - sensitive strains . 
In T16_Bacteria__L._lactis_subsp._cremoris strains grown in GM17 medium , the T18_Habitat__bile - resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid than the bile - sensitive strains . 
In T16_Bacteria__L._lactis_subsp._cremoris strains grown in GM17 medium , the bile - resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid than the T19_Habitat__bile - sensitive strains . 
In T23_Bacteria__L._lactis_subsp._lactis strains , T24_Habitat__bile resistances of some of the tested strains were altered by growth medium . 
In conclusion , the fatty acid compositions of the T31_Habitat__bile - resistant T32_Bacteria__lactococci differed from those of the bile - sensitive ones . 
In conclusion , the fatty acid compositions of the bile - resistant T32_Bacteria__lactococci differed from those of the T33_Habitat__bile - sensitive ones . 
More importantly , our data suggest that altering their fatty acid composition ( i.e. increased hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid and decreased hexadecenoic acid and C -19 cyclopropane fatty acid ) by changing growth conditions may be a useful way to enhance their T34_Habitat__bile resistance in T35_Bacteria__lactococci .
