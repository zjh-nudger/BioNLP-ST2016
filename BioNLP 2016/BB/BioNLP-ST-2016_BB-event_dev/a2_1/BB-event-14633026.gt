Characterization of a mosquitocidal T6_Bacteria__Bacillus_thuringiensis_serovar_sotto strain isolated from Okinawa , T8_Geographical__Japan . 
The strain T10_Bacteria__96-OK-85-24 significantly differed from the existing mosquitocidal B. thuringiensis strains in : ( 1 ) lacking the larvicidal activity against T12_Habitat__Culex_pipiens_molestus and haemolytic activity , and ( 2 ) SDS - PAGE profiles , immunological properties and N-terminal amino acid sequences of parasporal inclusion proteins . 
The strain 96-OK - 85-24 significantly differed from the existing mosquitocidal T11_Bacteria__B._thuringiensis strains in : ( 1 ) lacking the larvicidal activity against T12_Habitat__Culex_pipiens_molestus and haemolytic activity , and ( 2 ) SDS - PAGE profiles , immunological properties and N-terminal amino acid sequences of parasporal inclusion proteins . 
This is the first report of the occurrence of a mosquitocidal T14_Bacteria__B._thuringiensis strain with an unusual toxicity spectrum , lacking the activity against the T15_Habitat__culicine_mosquito .
