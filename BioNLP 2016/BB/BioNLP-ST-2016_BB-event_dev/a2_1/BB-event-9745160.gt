Ninety patients with active T14_Habitat__duodenal ulcer disease and T16_Bacteria__H_pylori infection , proven with the 13C - urea breath test and CLO test ( Campylobacter - like organism test ) were treated randomly in three therapeutic groups : Group A , DeNol 120 mg , amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg four times a day orally for 14 days ; Group B , omeprazole 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day for 14 days ; Group C , omeprazole 20 mg , clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for seven days .

Ninety T13_Habitat__patients_with_active_duodenal_ulcer_disease_and_H_pylori_infection , proven with the 13C - urea breath test and CLO test ( T17_Bacteria__Campylobacter - like organism test ) were treated randomly in three therapeutic groups : Group A , DeNol 120 mg , amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg four times a day orally for 14 days ; Group B , omeprazole 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day for 14 days ; Group C , omeprazole 20 mg , clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for seven days . 
Ninety patients with active T14_Habitat__duodenal ulcer disease and H pylori infection , proven with the 13C - urea breath test and CLO test ( T17_Bacteria__Campylobacter - like organism test ) were treated randomly in three therapeutic groups : Group A , DeNol 120 mg , amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg four times a day orally for 14 days ; Group B , omeprazole 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day for 14 days ; Group C , omeprazole 20 mg , clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for seven days .

Two months later , endoscopy , the CLO test and 13C - urea breath test were repeated to assess the eradication rate of T19_Bacteria__H_pylori and the T20_Habitat__ulcer - healing rate . 
Eighty - four T22_Habitat__patients completed the entire course of therapy and evaluation for T23_Bacteria__H_pylori infection . 
A therapeutic regime of one week's duration with lower cost , good compliance and mild side - effects may offer a good choice for treatment of T31_Habitat__duodenal_ulcer associated with T33_Bacteria__H_pylori infection in clinical practice .
