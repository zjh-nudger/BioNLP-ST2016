Evaluation of the role of T3_Bacteria__Carnobacterium_piscicola in spoilage of T4_Habitat__vacuum-_and_modified-atmosphere-packed_cold-smoked_salmon_stored_at_5_degrees_C . 
The T5_Habitat__microflora on spoiled cold - smoked salmon often consists of a mixture of T7_Bacteria__lactic_acid_bacteria ( LAB ) and Gram - negative bacteria . 
The microflora on T6_Habitat__spoiled_cold-smoked_salmon often consists of a mixture of T7_Bacteria__lactic_acid_bacteria ( LAB ) and Gram - negative bacteria . 
The T5_Habitat__microflora on spoiled cold - smoked salmon often consists of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria ( T8_Bacteria__LAB ) and Gram - negative bacteria . 
The microflora on T6_Habitat__spoiled_cold-smoked_salmon often consists of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria ( T8_Bacteria__LAB ) and Gram - negative bacteria . 
The shelf - life of T9_Habitat__vacuum-packed_cold-smoked_salmon , recorded by sensory evaluation , was four weeks at 5 degrees C and the microflora was composed of T12_Bacteria__LAB ( 10(6) -10 ( 7 ) cfu / g ) with an associate Gram - negative flora in varying levels ( 10(5) -10 ( 7 ) cfu / g ) . 
The shelf - life of vacuum - packed cold - smoked salmon , recorded by sensory evaluation , was four weeks at 5 degrees C and the T10_Habitat__microflora was composed of T12_Bacteria__LAB ( 10(6) -10 ( 7 ) cfu / g ) with an associate Gram - negative flora in varying levels ( 10(5) -10 ( 7 ) cfu / g ) . 
The Gram - negative flora on T15_Habitat__vacuum-packed_salmon was dominated by a T16_Bacteria__Vibrio_sp. , resembling V. marinus , Enterobacteriaceae ( Enterobacter agglomerans , Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis ) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila . 
The Gram - negative flora on T15_Habitat__vacuum-packed_salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp. , resembling T17_Bacteria__V._marinus , Enterobacteriaceae ( Enterobacter agglomerans , Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis ) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila . 
The Gram - negative flora on T15_Habitat__vacuum-packed_salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp. , resembling V. marinus , T18_Bacteria__Enterobacteriaceae ( Enterobacter agglomerans , Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis ) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila . 
The Gram - negative flora on T15_Habitat__vacuum-packed_salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp. , resembling V. marinus , Enterobacteriaceae ( T19_Bacteria__Enterobacter_agglomerans , Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis ) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila . 
The Gram - negative flora on T15_Habitat__vacuum-packed_salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp. , resembling V. marinus , Enterobacteriaceae ( Enterobacter agglomerans , T20_Bacteria__Serratia_liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis ) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila . 
The Gram - negative flora on T15_Habitat__vacuum-packed_salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp. , resembling V. marinus , Enterobacteriaceae ( Enterobacter agglomerans , Serratia liquefaciens and T21_Bacteria__Rahnella_aquatilis ) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila . 
The Gram - negative flora on T15_Habitat__vacuum-packed_salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp. , resembling V. marinus , Enterobacteriaceae ( Enterobacter agglomerans , Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis ) and occasionally T22_Bacteria__Aeromonas_hydrophila . 
Irrespective of the addition of nisin and / or CO2 - atmosphere , the T23_Habitat__LAB_microflora was dominated by T25_Bacteria__Carnobacterium_piscicola , which was found to account for 87% of the 255 LAB isolates characterized . 
Irrespective of the addition of nisin and / or CO2 - atmosphere , the T23_Habitat__LAB_microflora was dominated by Carnobacterium piscicola , which was found to account for 87% of the 255 T26_Bacteria__LAB isolates characterized . 
The spoilage potential of T28_Bacteria__C._piscicola isolates was further studied by inoculation of approx . 10(6) cfu / g in T29_Habitat__cold-smoked_salmon_stored_at_5_degrees_C . 
The T30_Habitat__salmon did not spoil within 4 weeks of storage in vacuum - or CO2 - atmosphere , and it is concluded that despite high levels ( > 10(7) cfu / g ) of T31_Bacteria__C._piscicola , sensory rejection was caused by autolytic changes .
