The presence of T9_Habitat__monoclonal_B_cells in T10_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori - chronic active gastritis has suggested that polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) data should be viewed with caution . 
We studied 1511 biopsies from eight T13_Habitat__patients_with_high-grade_primary_gastric_lymphoma , 25 with low-grade MALT lymphoma , 32 with atypical lymphoid infiltrates , and 39 with T19_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori - chronic active gastritis . 
We studied 1511 biopsies from eight T14_Habitat__patients_with_atypical_lymphoid_infiltrates , and 39 with T19_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori - chronic active gastritis . 
We studied 1511 biopsies from eight patients with high - grade primary T17_Habitat__gastric lymphoma , 25 with low-grade MALT lymphoma , 32 with atypical lymphoid infiltrates , and 39 with T19_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori - chronic active gastritis . 
We studied 1511 biopsies from eight patients with high - grade primary gastric lymphoma , 25 with low-grade T18_Habitat__MALT lymphoma , 32 with atypical lymphoid infiltrates , and 39 with T19_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori - chronic active gastritis . 
Because T32_Habitat__monoclonal_B_cells are observed in T33_Bacteria__Helicobacter_pylori - associated gastritis , the correct interpretation of clonality by PCR remains unclear .
