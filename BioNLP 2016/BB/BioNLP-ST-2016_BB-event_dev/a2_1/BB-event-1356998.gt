The genomes of T8_Bacteria__spotted_fever_group rickettsiae isolated in different geographical areas of T10_Geographical__Israel ( two from ticks and four from humans , obtained over a span of 20 years ) were studied by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and restriction endonuclease fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis . 
The genomes of T8_Bacteria__spotted_fever_group rickettsiae isolated in different geographical areas of Israel ( two from T11_Habitat__ticks and four from humans , obtained over a span of 20 years ) were studied by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and restriction endonuclease fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis . 
The genomes of T8_Bacteria__spotted_fever_group rickettsiae isolated in different geographical areas of Israel ( two from ticks and four from T12_Habitat__humans , obtained over a span of 20 years ) were studied by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and restriction endonuclease fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis .

The genomes of spotted fever group T9_Bacteria__rickettsiae isolated in different geographical areas of Israel ( two from ticks and four from T12_Habitat__humans , obtained over a span of 20 years ) were studied by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and restriction endonuclease fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis . 
The PCR products obtained with five pairs of oligonucleotide primers ( two primer sets derived from the 190-kDa polypeptide gene and three from the 120-kDa polypeptide gene ) and cleaved with restriction endonucleases were used to study the T15_Geographical__Israeli isolates and reference T16_Bacteria__Rickettsia_conorii isolates . 
Subtle differences between the PCR - RFLP patterns of T17_Geographical__Israeli isolates and the two T18_Bacteria__R._conorii_reference_strain_no._7 ) were seen when the PCR products derived from the 190-kDa gene - derived primer sets were digested . 
Subtle differences between the PCR - RFLP patterns of T17_Geographical__Israeli isolates and the two T19_Bacteria__R._conorii_reference_strain_Moroccan and no . 7 ) were seen when the PCR products derived from the 190-kDa gene - derived primer sets were digested . 
This study showed that the T21_Geographical__Israeli T22_Bacteria__spotted_fever_group isolates ( from both ticks and humans ) were genetically homogeneous by the criteria used in this study , despite the time and location differences in their original isolation , and different as a group from R. conorii . 
This study showed that the Israeli T22_Bacteria__spotted_fever_group isolates ( from both T23_Habitat__ticks and humans ) were genetically homogeneous by the criteria used in this study , despite the time and location differences in their original isolation , and different as a group from R. conorii . 
This study showed that the Israeli T22_Bacteria__spotted_fever_group isolates ( from both ticks and T24_Habitat__humans ) were genetically homogeneous by the criteria used in this study , despite the time and location differences in their original isolation , and different as a group from R. conorii .
