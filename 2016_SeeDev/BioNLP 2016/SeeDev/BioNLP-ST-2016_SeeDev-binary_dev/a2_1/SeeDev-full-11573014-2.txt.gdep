This prediction was confirmed by showing that T8_Gene__LEC1 and T9_Gene__FUS3 encode putative transcription factors that regulate critical embryonic processes ( 12 , 19 , 20 ) . 
Here we present evidence suggesting that T10_Gene__LEC2 likely encodes a transcriptional regulator with a significant role in T11_Development_Phase__embryogenesis .
