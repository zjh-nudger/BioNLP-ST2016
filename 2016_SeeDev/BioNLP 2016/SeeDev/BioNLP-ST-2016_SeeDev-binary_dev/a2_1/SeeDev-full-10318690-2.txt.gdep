However , T144_Protein__AGL15 may be necessary to either direct or support development in an T145_Regulatory_Network__embryonic_mode . 
The fact that T146_Tissue__immature_microspores accumulated low but detectable amounts of T149_Protein__AGL15 and also had embryogenic potential that can be expressed in culture may be significant in this regard . 
The fact that immature T147_Genotype__oilseed_rape T148_Tissue__microspores accumulated low but detectable amounts of AGL15 and also had embryogenic potential that can be expressed in culture may be significant in this regard .
