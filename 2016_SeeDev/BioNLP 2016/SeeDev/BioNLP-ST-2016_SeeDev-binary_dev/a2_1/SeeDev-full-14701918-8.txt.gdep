At least two hypotheses can explain the dependence of T6_Development_Phase__cell_morphogenesis on T7_Pathway__mucilage_synthesis . 
The formation of the T8_Tissue__apoplastic_space and T9_Tissue__cytoplasmic_column may be driven by the pressure of accumulating mucilage in the extracytoplasmic space and / or the formation of an osmotic gradient between the cell and the hydrophilic pectin may lead to the loss of turgor and size reduction of the vacuole . 
The formation of the T8_Tissue__apoplastic_space and cytoplasmic column may be driven by the pressure of accumulating T10_Pathway__mucilage in the extracytoplasmic space and / or the formation of an osmotic gradient between the cell and the hydrophilic pectin may lead to the loss of turgor and size reduction of the vacuole . 
The formation of the T8_Tissue__apoplastic_space and cytoplasmic column may be driven by the pressure of accumulating mucilage in the T11_Tissue__extracytoplasmic_space and / or the formation of an osmotic gradient between the cell and the hydrophilic pectin may lead to the loss of turgor and size reduction of the vacuole .

Such passive processes may contribute to T13_Development_Phase__cell_morphogenesis but seem too simple to account for the apparent complexity of the shape of the T14_Tissue__cytoplasmic_column . 
An alternate but not mutually exclusive explanation is that the T15_Pathway__synthesis_of_mucilage may represent or lead to the T16_Pathway__production_of_an_oligosaccharide_signal that stimulates the cell to undergo morphogenesis ( Dumville and Fry , 2000 ; Ridley et al. , 2001 ) .
