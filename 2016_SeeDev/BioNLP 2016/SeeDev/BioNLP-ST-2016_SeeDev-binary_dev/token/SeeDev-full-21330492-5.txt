Interestingly , after the heart stage , fus 3-3 dcl 1-15 and lec 2-1 dcl 1-15 embryos have high levels of chlorophyll and pAt2S3 : GFP , something not seen in either fus 3-3 or lec 2-1 embryos ( Meinke et al. , 1994 ; Kroj et al. , 2003 ; To et al. , 2006 ) , suggesting that after that stage , other miRNA - regulated factors can compensate for the absence of LEC2 or FUS3 .
