Given the documented genetic interactions and the similarities in effects on marker gene expression , we were surprised by the apparent lack of physical interaction between T1_Protein__ABI4 and any other T2_Protein_Family__ABIs . 
Although further truncations of T3_Protein__ABI4 in the BD fusion resulted in lower basal reporter - gene expression , none interacted with the T4_Protein__AD-ABIs ( data not shown ) .
