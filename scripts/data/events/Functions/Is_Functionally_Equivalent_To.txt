6. The MADS domain family consists of at least 36 members in Arabidopsis ( Liljegren et al. 1998 ) , including the well - known floral organ identity regulators AGAMOUS ( AG ) , APETALA3 ( AP3 ) , and PISTILLATA ; meristem identity regulators APETALA1 ( AP1 ) and CAULIFLOWER ; silique tissue identity regulators FRUITFULL / AGL8 , AGL1 , and AGL5 ; and a set of other AGL factors of unknown function expressed in flowers .

2. This pattern of gene regulation further distinguishes AGL15 from the large group of floral MADS box genes , including AP1 ( Mandel et al. 1992b ) and FRUITFULL / AGL8 ( Mandel and Yanofsky 1995a ; Gu et al. 1998 ) , which are preferentially expressed during the reproductive phase and are induced or upregulated during the transition to flowering ( Hempel et al. 1997 ) .

5. TTG1 ( TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 ) , TTG2 , and GL2 ( GLABRA2 ) , which were originally identified through their role in trichome specification , have defects in both mucilage and columella production in the seed coat ( Koornneef , 1981 ; Penfield et al. , 2001 ; Western et al. , 2001 ; Johnson et al. , 2002 ) .

8. SERK1 and BR Signaling A highly interesting finding was the identification of two members of the BR signaling pathway , the main BR receptor BRI1 ( Li and Chory , 1997 ) and its coreceptor BAK1 ( SERK3 ) ( Li et al. , 2002 ; Nam and Li , 2002 ) , as components of the SERK1 complex .
  1. E65	Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To	Element1:BAK1	Element2:SERK3
15. Genetic analysis of the serk 1-1 bri 1-119 double mutant suggests that SERK1–BRI1 interactions indeed affect BRI1 - mediated signaling in planta , but to a lesser extent than SERK3–BRI1 interactions .

9. ANT regulates ovule development and floral organ growth ( Elliott et al. , 1996 ; Mizukami and Fischer , 2000 ) , and PLETHORA1 ( PLT1 ) and PLT2 are required for stem cell specification and maintenance in the root meristem ( Aida et al. , 2004 ) .
  1. E28	Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To	Element1:PLT1	Element2:PLETHORA1
5. The 3′ - half of the 16-bp ANT - binding sequence is similar to the DRE sequences ( CCGAC ) , to which EREBP - like single AP2 domain factors binds , suggesting that two AP2 domains of ANT uniquely participate in DNA binding ( Nole - Wilson and Krizek , 2000 ; Krizek , 2003 ) .

18. Because the auxin signaling - responsive DR5rev promoter fused to GFP ( DR5rev∷GFP ) is specifically active in the hypophysis cells of wild - type globular embryos ( Friml et al. 2003 ) , and hypophysis specification is perturbed in dcl1 embryos , we examined the activity of DR5rev∷GFP in dcl 1-5 embryos to test whether DCL1 was required for appropriate auxin signaling .

0. The two apparently critical residues are located within a stretch of more than 100 amino acids , about one-third of the FUS3 sequence , which exhibits significant sequence similarity to a distinct domain , B3 or basic region 3 ( Giraudat et al. 1992 ) , characteristic of VP1 / ABI3 - like proteins .
  1. E16	Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To	Element1:basic region 3	Element2:B3
3. However , the B3 domains present in several of these proteins have less resemblance to FUS3 , VP1 , ABI3 ( Fig .  5a ) , as well as to the presumed VP1 / ABI3 orthologs of rice and bean ( Bobb et al. 1995 ; Hattori et al. 1994 ) which can be grouped together .
  2. E15	Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To	Element1:VP1	Element2:ABI3
2. Many additional presumed ABA - signaling components have been identified biochemically , based on binding to cis-acting regulatory elements such as ABREs ( ABA - response elements ; Busk and Pages , 1998 ) ; one - or two-hybrid screens in yeast ( Choi et al. , 2000 ; Hobo et al. , 1999 ; Kim et al. , 1997 ; Kurup et al. , 2000 ; Uno et al. , 2000 ) ; or correlations between kinase or phosphatase activity and ABA response ( Leung and Giraudat , 1998 ) .

7. Mutational analyses of VP1 / ABI3 - responsive promoters have shown that G-box elements such as those present in the Em1a and Em1b elements , although required for ABA regulation and consequently designated ABREs , are sufficient but not necessary for VP1 transactivation ( Vasil et al. , 1995 ) .

  7. E9	Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To	Element1:EmBP1 bZIP domain	Element2:ABI5 bZIP domain
13. Consequently , any interactions between ABI5 and VP1 / ABI3 need not be mechanistically similar to the previously described VP1–EmBP1 interactions .
  8. E11	Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To	Element1:ABI3	Element2:VP1
19. Consistent with this , rice homologs of ABI3 and ABI5 ( OSVP1 and TRAB1 , respectively ) have been shown to interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay , as well as in transient assays in plant cells ( Hobo et al. , 1999 ) .

6. MADS - domain proteins bind as either homo - or heterodimers to an A / T-rich cis element named the CArG motif ( C-A / T-rich - G , with a canonical sequence of CC[A / T]6GG ; for a review , see Riechmann and Meyerowitz , 1997 ) , and AGL15 has been shown to preferentially bind a CArG sequence with a longer A / T-rich core ( C[A / T]8G ) in vitro ( Tang and Perry , 2003 ) .

8. The carboxyl - terminal ( C ) domain is the most divergent , and in some cases functions as a transactivation domain ( Cho et al. , 1999 ; Honma and Goto , 2001 ; Lim et al. , 2000 ; Moon et al. , 1999 ; Ng and Yanofsky , 2001 ; Pelaz et al. , 2001 ) or is involved in the formation of ternary complexes ( Egea - Cortines et al. , 1999 ) .

13. However AP1 and SEP3 are also able to interact with the transcription co-repressors LEUNIG ( LUG ) and SEUSS ( SEU ) ( Sridhar et al. , 2006 ) , which prevent ectopic AG transcription ( Franks et al. , 2002 ; Liu and Meyerowitz , 1995 ) .

21. Although AGL15 has been reported as a protein co-purifying in the same complex as SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR - LIKE KINASE1 ( SERK1 ; Karlova et al. , 2006 ) , no direct interaction between AGL15 and a non-MADS domain protein has yet been reported .

22. Here we report that AGL15 interacts with members of the SIN3 histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) complex , and that a conserved LxLxL motif present in the C-terminal domain of AGL15 , which has been shown to be involved in transcriptional repression in other proteins ( Ohta et al. , 2001 ; Tiwari et al. , 2004 ) , is required for its association with one member of this complex , named SIN3 - associated polypeptide of 18 kDa ( SAP18 ) , in yeast two-hybrid studies .
