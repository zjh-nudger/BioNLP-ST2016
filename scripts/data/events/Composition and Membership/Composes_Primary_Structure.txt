Many additional presumed ABA - signaling components have been identified biochemically , based on binding to cis-acting regulatory elements such as ABREs ( ABA - response elements ; Busk and Pages , 1998 ) ; one - or two-hybrid screens in yeast ( Choi et al. , 2000 ; Hobo et al. , 1999 ; Kim et al. , 1997 ; Kurup et al. , 2000 ; Uno et al. , 2000 ) ; or correlations between kinase or phosphatase activity and ABA response ( Leung and Giraudat , 1998 ) .
