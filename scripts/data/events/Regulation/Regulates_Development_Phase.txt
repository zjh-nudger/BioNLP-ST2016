19. LEC1 is also involved in inhibiting premature germination . lec1 mutant embryos exhibit morphological and molecular characteristics of both embryogenesis and postgerminative seedling development , showing that aspects of both programs can occur simultaneously ( Meinke 1992Meinke , 1992 , 1994 ; West et al. 1994 ) .

26. Although nothing has been reported about how LEC class genes act at the molecular level , their involvement in many diverse aspects of embryogenesis suggests that these genes serve as regulators of higher plant embryonic processes .

0. The late stages of embryogenesis in higher plants are dominated by seed formation during which vegetative growth of the embryo is halted and storage reserves are accumulated .

4. In Arabidopsis thaliana , recessive mutations in the FUSCA3 gene ( FUS3 ) lead to a complex phenotype specifically affecting seed formation ( Bäumlein et al. 1994 ; Keith et al. 1994 ) .
