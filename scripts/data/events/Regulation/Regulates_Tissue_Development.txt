3. We showed that LEC2 RNA accumulates primarily during seed development , consistent with our finding that LEC2 shares greatest similarity with the B3 domain transcription factors that act primarily in developing seeds , VIVIPAROUS1 / ABA INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3 .

9. Moreover , postembryonic expression of LEC1 is sufficient to induce somatic embryogenesis in transgenic plants as occurs with 35S∷LEC2 seedlings , although somatic embryo formation is more robust with LEC2 .

2. According to the ‘ABC’ model for the determination of floral organ identity , A activity specifies sepals , A and B activities lead to petals , B and C activities lead to stamens , and C activity specifies carpels ( Weigel and Meyerowitz , 1994 ) .

11. The results of our study of organs produced during precocious germination in oilseed rape indicate that AGL15 also accumulates in cotyledons that are initiated outside of the seed environment .

0. Although the defect in mucilage production is readily explained by the putative function of MUM4 as an NDP - l-Rha synthase , the connection with the columella shape change is less obvious .

2. The formation of the apoplastic space and cytoplasmic column may be driven by the pressure of accumulating mucilage in the extracytoplasmic space and / or the formation of an osmotic gradient between the cell and the hydrophilic pectin may lead to the loss of turgor and size reduction of the vacuole .

0. Higher plant embryogenesis is divided conceptually into two distinct phases : early morphogenetic processes that give rise to embryonic cell types , tissues , and organ systems , and late maturation events that allow the fully developed embryo to enter a desiccated and metabolically quiescent state ( [52] and [13] ) .
