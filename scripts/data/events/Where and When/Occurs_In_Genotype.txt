36. For example , sporophytic mutations in cereals that affect development of a specialized seed coat tissue responsible for nutrient transfer to the endosperm cause defects in seed development and size ( 46–48 ) . ap2 mutants have defective seed coats in that they lack epidermal plateaus and mucilage , their outer integument cells are larger than those of wild type and are irregular in shape , and mutant seeds are hypersensitive to bleach ( 24 , 49 ) .

12. DCL1 transcripts were detected by quantitative RT–PCT ( qRT–PCR ) in both early globular embryos from wild - type plants and early globular embryos from selfed dcl 1-5 / + plants that developed normally , but were not detected in abnormal early globular embryos from selfed dcl 1-5 / + plants ( Supplemental Fig . 1 ) .
