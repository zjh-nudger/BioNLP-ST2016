Because the auxin signaling - responsive DR5rev promoter fused to GFP ( DR5rev∷GFP ) is specifically active in the hypophysis cells of wild - type globular embryos ( Friml et al. 2003 ) , and hypophysis specification is perturbed in dcl1 embryos , we examined the activity of DR5rev∷GFP in dcl 1-5 embryos to test whether DCL1 was required for appropriate auxin signaling .

22. AGL15 accumulation did not appear to be sufficient to confer an embryonic identity on a cell or cells : the floral organs of plants overexpressing AGL15 accumulated AGL15 ( Fig . 1c ) but maintained their identity as reproductive tissues .

24. The fact that immature oilseed rape microspores accumulated low but detectable amounts of AGL15 and also had embryogenic potential that can be expressed in culture may be significant in this regard .

1. Two lines of evidence suggest that this up-regulation occurs in the seed coat epidermis to support mucilage biosynthesis .

10. Therefore , we favor a model in which a seed coat - specific complex of TTG1 - bHLH - MYB causes activation of GL2 and the subsequent up-regulation of MUM4 during mucilage production ( Fig . 8 ) .

11. Recent results suggest that EGL3 ( ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 ) and / or TT8 ( TRANSPARENT TESTA8 ) are the bHLH proteins acting with TTG1 in the seed coat ( Zhang et al. , 2003 ) .

24. Although the most conspicuous function of AP2 is in flower development , its transcripts are not restricted to flowers but are detected in leaves , stems , and seedlings also ( 24 , 34 ) , opening the possibility of a more global function for AP2 .

16. AGL15 is expressed at lower levels after completion of germination in restricted sets of cells ( Fernandez et al. , 2000 ) .

15. AGL15 preferentially accumulates in a wide variety of tissues that develop in an embryonic mode ( Heck et al. , 1995 ; Perry et al. , 1996 , 1999 ; Rounsley et al. , 1995 ) , and constitutive expression promotes somatic embryogenesis ( Harding et al. , 2003 ) .

32. These results strongly suggest that WRI1 , which is a limiting factor of lipogenic gene expression in seeds , directly induces the transcriptional activation of these genes at the onset of the maturation phase .

0. Early dcl1 mutant embryos lack miR156 and exhibit premature expression of miR156 targets SPL10 and SPL11 , which in turn induces precocious expression of genes normally induced during the maturation phase of embryogenesis .

17. After morphogenesis , seed plant embryos transition to a maturation phase , when they accumulate storage proteins , undergo desiccation tolerance , and prepare to enter into a state of dormancy prior to germination .

14. Perhaps the loss of both miR156 - mediated regulation of SPL transcripts and miR166 - mediated regulation of HD - ZIPIII transcripts in dcl1 embryos is responsible for the embryonic patterning phenotypes observed .

6. Since the reduction of WOX2 transcripts in dcl1 eight - cell embryos was the first detectable differentiation defect , and homeobox genes related to WOX2 have been implicated in maintaining stem cells during post - embryonic development ( Laux et al. 1996 ; Mayer et al. 1998 ; Wu et al. 2005 ) , we speculate that premature expression of miRNA targets leads to the reduction of WOX2 transcripts in dcl1 embryos and ultimately contributes to precocious differentiation and subsequent loss of developmental potential in preglobular cell types .
