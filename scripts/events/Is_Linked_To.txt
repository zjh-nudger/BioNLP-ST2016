7. Family members that are preferentially expressed in developmental contexts other than the flower have also been identified ( Rounsley et al. 1995 ) and include such factors as ANR1 , which plays a role in control of root architecture in response to nutrient availability ( Zhang and Forde 1998 ) , and FLOWERING LOCUS C , a recently identified repressor of flowering ( Michaels and Amasino 1999 ) .
