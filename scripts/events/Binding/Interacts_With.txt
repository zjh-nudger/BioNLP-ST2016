10. In the literature HDACs are generally associated with the repression of gene expression ; however , in plants HDA19 has been shown to interact with bnKCP , and exerts a modest transactivation of reporter genes ( Gao et al. , 2003 ) .
  1. E1	Interacts_With	Agent:HDA19	Target:bnKCP

9. It was subsequently shown that both VP1 and EmBP1 , an Em1a - binding bZIP protein , specifically interact with GF14 , a 14-3 -3 protein which may provide a structural link between these transcription factors ( Schultz et al. , 1998 ) .
  2. E16	Interacts_With	Agent:VP1	Target:GF14

10. There is also a rapidly growing body of knowledge where plant MADS are reported to interact with other factors , such as putative transcription factors ( Causier et al. , 2003 ; Masiero et al. , 2002 ) , or co-repressors ( Sridhar et al. , 2006 ) , RNA - binding proteins ( Pelaz et al. , 2001 ) , post - translational modifying factors ( Fujita et al. , 2003Gamboa et al. , 2001 ; Yalovsky et al. , 2000 ) and others ( Cseke et al. , 2007 ; Honma and Goto , 2001 ) .

  5. E3	Interacts_With	Agent:SEP3	Target:LUG
14. Neither LUG nor SEU are predicted to encode a recognizable DNA - binding motif , but SEU has been shown to associate in vivo with an AG cis-regulatory region containing a putative CArG motif , perhaps through binding to DNA - bound SEP3 ( Sridhar et al. , 2006 ) .
  6. E5	Interacts_With	Agent:SEU	Target:AG cis-regulatory region containing a putative CArG motif
22. Here we report that AGL15 interacts with members of the SIN3 histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) complex , and that a conserved LxLxL motif present in the C-terminal domain of AGL15 , which has been shown to be involved in transcriptional repression in other proteins ( Ohta et al. , 2001 ; Tiwari et al. , 2004 ) , is required for its association with one member of this complex , named SIN3 - associated polypeptide of 18 kDa ( SAP18 ) , in yeast two-hybrid studies .

0. The interaction of AGL15 with members of the SIN3 / HDAC1 complex suggests a mechanism that could explain its function as a transcriptional repressor in planta Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) enzymes remove acetyl groups from histones , and hypoacetylation results in a decrease in the space between the nucleosome and the DNA that is wrapped around it .
  1. E1	Interacts_With	Agent:AGL15	Target:SIN3/HDAC1 complex
5. We demonstrated that SAP18 is able to associate with DNA - bound AGL15 in vitro , but is not able to directly interact with a strong AGL15 binding site ( Figure 7 ) .
