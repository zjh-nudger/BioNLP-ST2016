Because the auxin signaling - responsive DR5rev promoter fused to GFP ( DR5rev∷GFP ) is specifically active in the hypophysis cells of wild - type globular embryos ( Friml et al. 2003 ) , and hypophysis specification is perturbed in dcl1 embryos , we examined the activity of DR5rev∷GFP in dcl 1-5 embryos to test whether DCL1 was required for appropriate auxin signaling .

Since the reduction of WOX2 transcripts in dcl1 eight - cell embryos was the first detectable differentiation defect , and homeobox genes related to WOX2 have been implicated in maintaining stem cells during post - embryonic development ( Laux et al. 1996 ; Mayer et al. 1998 ; Wu et al. 2005 ) , we speculate that premature expression of miRNA targets leads to the reduction of WOX2 transcripts in dcl1 embryos and ultimately contributes to precocious differentiation and subsequent loss of developmental potential in preglobular cell types .
