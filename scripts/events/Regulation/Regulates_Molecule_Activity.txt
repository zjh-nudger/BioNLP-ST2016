49. Given the dramatic changes in hexose levels in ap2 mutants , potential targets of AP2 activity are enzymes involved in sugar metabolism , such as cell - wall - bound invertases .

53. Cell - wall - bound invertase activity decreases during the late phase of seed development , and sucrose is transported directly into embryo cells where it is hydrolyzed by sucrose synthase .

54. Cell - wall - bound invertase activity has been correlated with seed cell number both in fava bean cultivars that exhibit variations in seed size and in the maize miniature1 mutant that is defective in the enzyme ( 15 , 53 ) .

14. These interactions suggested analogy with the mammalian CDC48 homologue p97 / VCP complex , in which p97 / VCP can be phosphorylated by the JAK -2 kinase and dephosphorylated by the phosphatase PTPH1 that associates with a 14-3 -3 protein ( Zhang et al. , 1997 , 1999 ) .

27. TGF - ß binding to the TßRII homodimers promotes the formation of (TßRI)2 / (TßRII)2 heterodimers , in which TßRI is phosphorylated by the constitutively active TßRII and becomes activated to propagate the TGF - ß signal .

39. For two other LRR - RLKs , CLV1 ( Williams et al. , 1997 ) and FLS2 ( Gomez - Gomez et al. , 2001 ) , it has been shown that KAPP functions as a negative regulator , and it may have the same role in controlling signaling through the SERK1 receptor .

0. AGL15 binds directly to and represses LEA76 , CBF2 and AGL18 in planta It is becoming increasingly apparent that autoregulatory loops are a common phenomenon in the regulation of MADS-box genes in plants ( Gómez - Mena et al. , 2005 ; Honma and Goto , 2000 ; Zhu and Perry , 2005 ) .
