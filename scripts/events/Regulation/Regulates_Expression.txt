2. This pattern of gene regulation further distinguishes AGL15 from the large group of floral MADS box genes , including AP1 ( Mandel et al. 1992b ) and FRUITFULL / AGL8 ( Mandel and Yanofsky 1995a ; Gu et al. 1998 ) , which are preferentially expressed during the reproductive phase and are induced or upregulated during the transition to flowering ( Hempel et al. 1997 ) .

17. Unlike most other embryonic regulators that function during specific stages of embryogenesis ( 8–11 ) , LEC genes are unique in that they are required for normal development during both the morphogenesis and maturation phases .

31. We cloned the LEC2 gene and showed that it is expressed preferentially during embryogenesis and encodes a protein with similarity to other seed - specific transcription factors .
  5. E55	Regulates_Expression	Agent:embryogenesis	DNA:LEC2
1. Our findings that the LEC2 gene encodes a B3 domain protein ( Fig . 3 ) and is expressed primarily during embryogenesis ( Fig . 4 ) suggest that it , like LEC1 and FUS3 , is a transcriptional regulator of seed development .

5. TTG1 ( TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 ) , TTG2 , and GL2 ( GLABRA2 ) , which were originally identified through their role in trichome specification , have defects in both mucilage and columella production in the seed coat ( Koornneef , 1981 ; Penfield et al. , 2001 ; Western et al. , 2001 ; Johnson et al. , 2002 ) .

16. Alternatively , because the maternal plant contributes two genome equivalents to the triploid endosperm , seed mass may be affected by AP2 gene dosage in the endosperm .
  1. E108	Regulates_Expression	Agent:endosperm	DNA:AP2
20. Conversely , a recent study used genetic experiments to conclude that AP2 acts through both the endosperm and maternal tissues to affect seed size ( 40 ) .
  2. E107	Regulates_Expression	Agent:maternal tissues	DNA:AP2
  3. E109	Regulates_Expression	Agent:endosperm	DNA:AP2
15. One interpretation of our result is that AP2 activity in maternal tissues , potentially including the seed coat , is more important than its activity in the embryo and endosperm in controlling seed mass .

9. CLV3 presumably acts as an extracellular ligand of the CLV1 receptor kinase complex , which eventually leads to downregulation of WUS transcription in the recipient cells ( Clark et al. , 1997 ; Stone et al. , 1998 ; Trotochaud et al. , 1999 ; Rojo et al. , 2002 ; Lenhard and Laux , 2003 ) .

10. In floral meristems that are homologous to indeterminate shoot meristems , the AGAMOUS ( AG ) gene represses WUS expression late in flower development to terminate the stem cell niche after a limited number of organs have been formed ( Lenhard et al. , 2001 ; Lohmann et al. , 2001 ) .

18. We show that the premature termination of the shoot meristem in l28 mutants is caused by a mutation in the APETALA2 ( AP2 ) gene that was previously identified as one of the components of the ABC model in floral patterning , where it represses AG ( Bowman et al. , 1991 ; Drews et al. , 1991 ) , in floral transition ( Jofuku et al. , 1994 ; Okamuro et al. , 1997b ) , and in the control of seed size ( Jofuku et al. , 2005 ; Ohto et al. , 2005 ) .
  12. E20	Regulates_Expression	Agent:AP2	DNA:AG
19. In this article , we show that maintenance of the stem cell niche in the primary shoot meristem requires the activity of AP2 and redundant factor(s) via an AG independent mechanism that involves interaction with the WUS - CLV3 feedback loop .
  13. E26	Regulates_Expression	Agent:primary shoot meristem	DNA:AP2
8. A plausible interpretation of these data is that l28 acts as a dominant - negative allele of AP2 and thus identifies a novel pathway in shoot meristem development .

No noticeable increase in AGL18 transcription has been observed in plants homozygous for null alleles of AGL15 ( Figure 5b ) or vice versa ( unpublished data ) , but given that AGL15 is able to repress its own transcription ( Zhu and Perry , 2005 ) , and the close similarity and redundancy between AGL15 and AGL18 ( Adamczyk et al. , 2007 ) , it is possible that any increase in expression is masked by a subsequent autorepression or higher levels of redundancy involving other MADS - domain proteins .

Because the auxin signaling - responsive DR5rev promoter fused to GFP ( DR5rev∷GFP ) is specifically active in the hypophysis cells of wild - type globular embryos ( Friml et al. 2003 ) , and hypophysis specification is perturbed in dcl1 embryos , we examined the activity of DR5rev∷GFP in dcl 1-5 embryos to test whether DCL1 was required for appropriate auxin signaling .

0. Early dcl1 mutant embryos lack miR156 and exhibit premature expression of miR156 targets SPL10 and SPL11 , which in turn induces precocious expression of genes normally induced during the maturation phase of embryogenesis .

18. We found that miR156 - mediated regulation of SPL10 and SPL11 prevents the transcription factor products of these genes from prematurely inducing seed maturation genes before the embryo has formed .

  31. E40	Regulates_Expression	Agent:miR156	DNA:SPL10
19. To the extent that this regulation forestalls the morphogenesis-to - maturation - phase transition , this newly identified role for miR156 - mediated repression of SPL genes resembles that observed for vegetative - , reproductive - , and meristem identity - phase transitions during post - embryonic development ( Wu and Poethig 2006 ; Gandikota et al. 2007 ; Schwarz et al. 2008 ; Wang et al. 2009 ; Wu et al. 2009 ; Yamaguchi et al. 2009 ) .
  32. E39	Regulates_Expression	Agent:miR156	DNA:SPL
22. Later in development , the miR156 - mediated repression of SPL10 and SPL11 must presumably be overcome in order for the embryo to undergo the morphogenesis-to - maturation transition .
