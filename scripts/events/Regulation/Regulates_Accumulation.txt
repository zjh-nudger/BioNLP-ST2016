17. Here , we show that AP2 regulates ERF genes such as AtEBP and AtERF1 , and the over - expression of AtEBP causes the accumulation of AP2 transcripts .

6. Recent reports showed that AP2 controlled seed mass ( Jofuku et al. , 1994 , 2005 ; Ohto et al. , 2005 ) and that expression of the AP2 protein was translationally regulated by the microRNA mi172 ( Aukerman and Sakai , 2003 ; Chen , 2004 ) .

17. Published results support a role for SIN3 / HDAC1 - mediated repression in regulation of LEA76 : trichostatin A , a specific inhibitor of HDAC , causes an increase in LEA76 transcript during seed germination ( Tai et al. , 2005 ) .

12. LEA76 , CBF2 ( Figure 5a ) and other putative AGL15 downstream target genes ( K. Hill , H. Wang and S.E. Perry , unpublished data ) , are not as highly induced by ectopic expression of AGL15 - VP16 as expected , especially when compared with levels of AGL18 transcript accumulation brought about by AGL15 - VP16 ( Figure 5a ) .

13. It has been demonstrated that AGL15 and AGL18 perform at least partially redundant functions ( Adamczyk et al. , 2007 , S. Perry , unpublished data ) , and given that AGL15 - VP16 induces accumulation of AGL18 transcript ( Figure 5a ) , AGL18 might be subsequently repressing CBF2 and LEA76 , and thus masking to some degree AGL15 - VP16 - mediated transcription , although an increase in response to AGL15 - VP16 is still apparent .

6. Since the reduction of WOX2 transcripts in dcl1 eight - cell embryos was the first detectable differentiation defect , and homeobox genes related to WOX2 have been implicated in maintaining stem cells during post - embryonic development ( Laux et al. 1996 ; Mayer et al. 1998 ; Wu et al. 2005 ) , we speculate that premature expression of miRNA targets leads to the reduction of WOX2 transcripts in dcl1 embryos and ultimately contributes to precocious differentiation and subsequent loss of developmental potential in preglobular cell types .
