5. Finally , the MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS - LIKE15 and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein , a member of the CONSTANS family , were identified as part of the SERK1 complex .

6. Using blue native gel electrophoresis , we show that SERK1 and SERK3 are part of BRI1 - containing multiple protein complexes with relative masses between 300 and 500 kD .

10. SERK3 or BRI1 - ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 ( BAK1 ) is part of the BR receptor complex and is proposed to function as a coreceptor of the BRI1 protein ( Li et al. , 2002 ; Nam and Li , 2002 ) .

8. SERK1 and BR Signaling A highly interesting finding was the identification of two members of the BR signaling pathway , the main BR receptor BRI1 ( Li and Chory , 1997 ) and its coreceptor BAK1 ( SERK3 ) ( Li et al. , 2002 ; Nam and Li , 2002 ) , as components of the SERK1 complex .

16. Notably , none of the proposed downstream components of BRI1 , such as BES1 , BZR1 , or BIN2 ( Li and Nam , 2002 ; Wang et al. , 2002b ; Yin et al. , 2002 ) , was detected in the SERK1 complex .

56. The other putative transcription factor found in the SERK1 complex belongs to a large family of CO - like zinc finger transcription factors , in which the zinc finger region regulates protein–protein interactions , as found for several animal transcription factors ( reviewed in Griffiths et al. , 2003 ) .

45. Two transcription factors were found to be associated with the SERK1 complex : AGL15 and a putative CO - like B-box zinc finger protein .

31. Other SERK1 Complex Components The presence of the PP2C phosphatase KAPP , 14-3 -3 ν , and CDC48A in the SERK1 complex confirms previously obtained results using yeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro interaction studies ( Rienties et al. , 2005 ) .
