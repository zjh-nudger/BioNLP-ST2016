1. We propose that additional plant miRNAs—including miR160 , miR166 , and miR319—also forestall expression of differentiation - promoting transcription factors such as ARF17 , CNA , PHB , PHV , and TCP4 .

25. Two other LEC class genes , LEC2 and FUSCA3 ( FUS3 ) , are thought to share similar or overlapping functions with LEC1 , including the specification or cotyledon identity and the maintenance of maturation ( [2] , [18] and [29] ) .
