10. We initially isolated AGL15 as a low-abundance mRNA that preferentially accumulates in developing embryos ( Heck et al. 1995 ) ; Rounsley et al. 1995 independently isolated it from a floral cDNA library .

0. Although small amounts of AGL15 protein might accumulate in these tissues throughout the vegetative phase , we conclude that the amounts of nuclear - localized AGL15 protein approach those seen in young embryos only during the earliest stages of vegetative growth in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis .

26. FUS3 also encodes a regulatory protein : a B3 domain transcription factor that accumulates primarily during seed development ( 19 ) .

3. We showed that LEC2 RNA accumulates primarily during seed development , consistent with our finding that LEC2 shares greatest similarity with the B3 domain transcription factors that act primarily in developing seeds , VIVIPAROUS1 / ABA INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3 .

18. Our finding that both LEC2 and LEC1 RNAs are detected at the earliest embryonic stages tested ( Fig . 4 ; ref . 12 ) opens the possibility that both genes are involved in establishing embryogenic competence during zygotic embryogenesis .

12. This result suggests that the chromodomain protein PKL acts normally to repress LEC1 in postgerminative roots , and therefore that LEC1 , at least in part , mediates somatic embryo formation in pkl mutants .

18. Because the auxin signaling - responsive DR5rev promoter fused to GFP ( DR5rev∷GFP ) is specifically active in the hypophysis cells of wild - type globular embryos ( Friml et al. 2003 ) , and hypophysis specification is perturbed in dcl1 embryos , we examined the activity of DR5rev∷GFP in dcl 1-5 embryos to test whether DCL1 was required for appropriate auxin signaling .
