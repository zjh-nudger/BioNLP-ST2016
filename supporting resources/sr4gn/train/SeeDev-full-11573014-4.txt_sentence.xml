<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Role of LEC2 in Seed Development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Two consequences of expressing the LEC2 genepostembryonically provide insight into its role in embryo developmentand strongly support the conclusion that LEC2 is a key regulator ofembryogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>First, although seedlings expressing the35S∷LEC2 gene exhibited a range ofmorphologies (Fig. 5), approximately one-third possessed embryonicrather than postgerminative characteristics</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Cotyledons of theseseedlings remained fleshy and did not expand, and their roots andhypocotyls did not extend, suggesting that ectopic LEC2expression can extend embryonic development.35S∷LEC2 seedlings at the other end of thephenotypic spectrum initially resembled wild type</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>The reason for thisrange of phenotypes is not clear, but one possibility is that itrelates to differences in transgene expression levels</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Second,regardless of their initial morphology,35S∷LEC2 seedlings gave rise to somaticembryos as indicated by their morphological similarities with zygoticembryos, their expression of embryo-specific genes, and theirestablishment of functional apical meristems (Figs. 5 and 6)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Together,these results suggest that ectopic LEC2 expression issufficient to establish an embryonic environment that promotes somaticembryo formation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>In this regard, it is possible that LEC2 RNA accumulation is regulated posttranscriptionally, thereby accountingfor the ability of somatic embryos to “germinate” and, in somecases, give rise to masses of vegetatively growing plantlets</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>Transgenic seedlings ectopically expressing a different LECgene, LEC1, have embryonic characteristics that aresubstantially similar to those of 35S∷LEC2embryo-like seedlings (12)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>Moreover, postembryonic expression of LEC1 is sufficient to induce somatic embryogenesis intransgenic plants as occurs with 35S∷LEC2seedlings, although somatic embryo formation is more robust with LEC2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>Recessive mutations in the Arabidopsis PICKLE (PKL) gene also induce somatic embryogenesis inpostgerminative roots cultured on hormone-free medium (40)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>However, LEC1 is expressed in the roots of pkl mutant butnot wild-type seedlings (41)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>This result suggests that thechromodomain protein PKL acts normally to repress LEC1 inpostgerminative roots, and therefore that LEC1, at least in part,mediates somatic embryo formation in pkl mutants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>Given ourresults, we hypothesize that LEC2 may also be derepressed inpkl mutants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>The ability of LEC2 and LEC1 to induce somaticembryogenesis suggests a role for the genes in the establishment ofembryogenic competence</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>Somatic plant cells generally must be inducedto become competent for somatic embryogenesis (42–44)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>Embryogeniccompetence is often induced by culturing cells with the hormone auxinand, sometimes cytokinin, although completion of somatic embryogenesisusually requires removal of the hormone(s)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>LEC2 and LEC1 obviate theneed for hormone treatments in the acquisition of embryogeniccompetence, suggesting the two LEC transcription factors activate genesthat play roles in the initiation of somatic embryogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>Our findingthat both LEC2 and LEC1 RNAs are detected at theearliest embryonic stages tested (Fig. 4; ref. 12) opens thepossibility that both genes are involved in establishing embryogeniccompetence during zygotic embryogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>Thus, the role of LEC2 and LEC1 in somatic embryogenesis may reflect their function in zygoticembryogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='21'>Similarities in the expression patterns andoverexpression phenotypes of LEC2 and LEC1suggest that they may have partially overlapping roles early in zygoticembryogenesis to induce embryo formation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='22'>This interpretation isconsistent with analyses showing that lec1 lec2 doublemutants arrest at an earlier embryonic stage than either single mutant,which indicates partial genetic redundancy (12, 15)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='23'>Although LEC1 and LEC2 are each sufficient toinduce embryogenic competence in somatic cells, they have similar butnot identical functions</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='24'>Mutations in each gene result in distinctphenotypes, and the double mutant displays a synergistic phenotype (12,15, 16)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='25'>Furthermore, the vast majority of35S∷LEC1 seedlings arrest as embryo-likeseedlings and fail to develop further, although cotyledon-like organssometimes form in place of the first true leaves (12)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='26'>By contrast,35S∷LEC2 embryo-like seedlings continued toproliferate, producing callus, cotyledon-like and leaf-like organs inaddition to somatic embryos</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='27'>Thus, LEC1 and LEC2 may have complementarybut partially redundant functions in embryo formation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='28'>The preciseroles of LEC1 and LEC2 in embryo development remain to be determined.</ABSTRACT>
