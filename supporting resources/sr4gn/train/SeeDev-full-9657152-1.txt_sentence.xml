<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) gene is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>We isolated the LEC1 gene and showed that it functions at an early developmental stage to maintain embryonic cell fate</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>The LEC1 gene encodes a transcription factor homolog, the CCAAT boxâ€“binding factor HAP3 subunit</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>LEC1 RNA accumulates only during seed development in embryo cell types andin endosperm tissue</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Ectopic postembryonic expression of the LEC1gene in vegetative cells induces the expression of embryo-specificgenes and initiates formation of embryo-like structures</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Our resultssuggest that LEC1 is an important regulator of embryo development thatactivates the transcription of genes required for both embryomorphogenesis and cellular differentiation.prs.rt("abs_end");</ABSTRACT>
