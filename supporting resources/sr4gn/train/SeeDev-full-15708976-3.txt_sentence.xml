<ABSTRACT sid='1'>AP2 Activity Controls Seed Mass</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>AP2 was identified originally as a homeotic gene required for the specification of floral organ identity and was shown to encodean AP2/EREBP transcription factor (24, 25)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>Here, we show that loss-of-function ap2 mutants produce large seeds</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Our studies using an allelic series of mutants provide strong support that AP2 functions directly in controlling seed mass (Table 2)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>A recent study provided additional support for this conclusion by showing that transgene suppression of AP2 activity in Arabidopsis produced defective flowers and large seeds (40)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Thus, the extent of AP2 gene activity, based on its well defined role in flower development, plays a role in determining seed mass.ap2 mutations negatively affect plant fertility, primarily through disruption of flower structure that limits the efficiencyof self-pollination in mutant plants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Given that limited availability of resources in the maternal plant appears to accountfor the negative correlation between seed number and seed mass (4), ap2 mutants are expected to produce seeds larger than wild-type plants with normal fertility</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>We confirmed that reduced fertilitydid affect seed mass and could account for ≈33% of the increase in average seed weight observed in a strong ap2 mutant (Table 3)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>However, the remaining, much larger effect of AP2 on seed mass must be attributed to factors unrelated to fertility</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>The early flowering of plants with strong ap2 mutant alleles (Table 1) provides additional support for the conclusion that the effects of the ap2 mutation on seed mass is not solely due to its effects on fertility</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>Leaf number is closely related to the availability ofreproductive resources in the maternal plant (13). ap2 mutants produced fewer leaves than wild type and, presumably, have fewer resources available</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>Yet, ap2 mutants gave rise to significantly larger seeds</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>Maternal Effect of AP2 on Seed Mass</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>Experiments in which wildtype and ap2 mutant genotypes were crossed reciprocally (Table 3) provided an important clue about the mechanisms controlling seed mass by showing that AP2 acts through the maternal genome</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>Consistent with this finding are analyses of reciprocal crosses in several crop speciesshowing that seed mass is often influenced by the genotype of the maternal plant (41)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>One interpretation of our result is that AP2 activity in maternal tissues, potentially including the seed coat, is more important than its activity in the embryo andendosperm in controlling seed mass</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>Alternatively, because the maternal plant contributes two genome equivalents to the triploidendosperm, seed mass may be affected by AP2 gene dosage in the endosperm</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>A QTL analysis of small- and large-seeded Arabidopsis ecotypes suggests that maternal tissues are important in determining seed mass (13)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>A number of QTL affecting seed mass colocalized with QTL for maternal traits such as seed number, fruit size, and plantresources, suggesting that they operate through maternal tissues</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>The gene identities of these QTL have not been determined,although AP2 does appear to colocalize to a QTL affecting seed mass at the bottom of chromosome IV (13)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='21'>Conversely, a recent study used genetic experiments to conclude that AP2 acts through both the endosperm and maternal tissues to affect seed size (40)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='22'>The endosperm has been implicated to serve as the site of parent-of-origin effects on seed mass through the imprinting ofgenes thought to be involved in enhancing or suppressing endosperm size and, therefore, seed and embryo mass (21–23)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='23'>Although little is known of the mechanisms mediating parent-of-origin effects on seed mass, no current evidence pointsto an involvement of AP2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='24'>For example, mutations in three genes, MEA, FIE, and FIS2, each induce endosperm phenotypes that mimic paternal genomic excess (39, 42–44)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='25'>However, these mutations are inherited differently than AP2 is in that ap2 is a maternal sporophytic mutation, whereas mea, fie, and fis2, are female gametophytic mutations</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='26'>Thus, AP2 does not act equivalently with these other genes, although they could participate in a common pathway</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='27'>Two other genes, IKU1 and IKU2, have been proposed to mediate the effects of maternal and paternal dosage on seed size, because mutations in either geneaffect many aspects of endosperm development (45)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='28'>However, unlike AP2, both iku mutations are sporophytic recessive and not maternal-effect mutations</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='29'>Thus, the IKU genes are also likely to operate differently than does AP2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='30'>How does AP2 act maternally to control seed mass? Our experiments suggest that AP2 acts, in part, through its effects on both embryo cell number and size (Fig. 2 and Table 4)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='31'>Others have shown that changes in cell number and size underlie ecotype variations in Arabidopsis seed size (13)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='32'>Similar to our findings, this study of natural variation concluded that cell number differences are controlled by maternalfactors</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='33'>However, by contrast to our results with AP2, ecotype differences in cell size were attributed to nonmaternal allelic variation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='34'>Our finding that AP2 acts maternally to affect embryo cell size may indicate that it operates through a mechanism that was not uncovered by studiesof natural ecotype variations</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='35'>The seed coat has been implicated to influence seed mass</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='36'>For example, sporophytic mutations in cereals that affect developmentof a specialized seed coat tissue responsible for nutrient transfer to the endosperm cause defects in seed development andsize (46–48). ap2 mutants have defective seed coats in that they lack epidermal plateaus and mucilage, their outer integument cells are largerthan those of wild type and are irregular in shape, and mutant seeds are hypersensitive to bleach (24, 49)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='37'>Although it is not clear whether these defects are directly associated with AP2 effects on seed mass, they emphasize that the maternal component of the seed is defective in ap2 mutants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='38'>AP2, Seed Mass, and Soluble Sugar Metabolism</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='39'>Our findings that the ap2 mutation acts maternally, potentially through the seed coat, to control seed mass (Table 3) and affects soluble sugar metabolism during seed development (Fig. 4) provide a potential explanation for the increase in embryo cell number in ap2 mutant seeds (Table 4)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='40'>During seed development, modulation of hexose and sucrose levels has been implicated to control cellular activities (reviewedin ref. 15)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='41'>Specifically, a high ratio of hexose to sucrose is correlated strongly with mitotic activity during the early morphogenesisphase of seed development, whereas a higher proportion of sucrose to hexose is associated with cell expansion and seed fillingduring the late maturation phase (14–16)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='42'>For example, immature fava bean embryos cultured with high concentrations of hexose continue to undergo cell divisionswhereas those cultured with high sucrose concentration enter the maturation phase (15)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='43'>Thus, cell division during the morphogenesis phase and seed filling during the maturation phase appear to correlate withchanges in hexose and sucrose levels.ap2 mutations induced changes in the levels of hexose and sucrose in developing seeds</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='44'>These changes resulted in hexose/sucroseratios that reached a higher maximal level in ap2 mutant seeds compared with wild-type seeds and that remained high for a longer period of seed development in ap2 mutants than they did in wild type (Fig. 4)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='45'>For example, hexose/sucrose ratios remained high at 9 and 11 DAP in ap2 mutants but was very low during the same period of wild-type seed development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='46'>We speculate that the altered hexose/sucroseratios during ap2 mutant seed development may promote an extended period of cell division that could account for the increase in embryo cellnumber observed in ap2 mutants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='47'>AP2 is a transcription factor</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='48'>Thus, it is likely to affect seed mass by regulating the expression of other genes</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='49'>Given thedramatic changes in hexose levels in ap2 mutants, potential targets of AP2 activity are enzymes involved in sugar metabolism, such as cell-wall-bound invertases</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='50'>Sucrose is transported from photosyntheticorgans to the seed coat, a maternally derived structure, where it is metabolized differently early and late in embryogenesis (14, 50–52)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='51'>During the early phase of favabean seed development, cell-wall-bound invertases localized in thin-walled parenchyma, theinnermost seed coat tissue, hydrolyze sucrose</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='52'>Hexoses formed by the reaction move apoplastically and are transported intoembryo cells</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='53'>Cell-wall-bound invertase activity decreases during the late phase of seed development, and sucrose is transporteddirectly into embryo cells where it is hydrolyzed by sucrose synthase</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='54'>Cell-wall-bound invertase activity has been correlatedwith seed cell number both in fava bean cultivars that exhibit variations in seed size and in the maize miniature1 mutant that is defective in the enzyme (15, 53)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='55'>Thus, AP2 may affect seed mass by controlling cell-wall-bound invertase activity</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='56'>We note that two other members of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor family have roles that appear to intersect with thoseof AP2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='57'>Mutations in the Arabidopsis WRINKLED1 gene lead to defects in carbohydrate metabolism and reductions in seed mass and oil content (38, 54)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='58'>Arabidopsis AINTEGUMENTA gene is thought to play a role in controlling cell proliferation (55, 56)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='59'>Ectopic expression of AINTEGUMENTA caused plant organs, including seeds, to increase in size in both transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco (57)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='60'>The increase in seed size in transgenic plants appears to result from an increase in cell number during seed development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='61'>Thus, other AP2/EREBP proteins may function in a pathway similar to that of AP2.</ABSTRACT>
