<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Arabidopsis embryos lacking DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), which is required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, arrest early in development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>To assess the functions of embryonic miRNAs,we determined the developmental and molecular consequences of DCL1 loss</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>We found that DCL1 is required for cell differentiation events as early as the eight-cell stage and soon thereafter for proper division of thehypophysis and subprotoderm cells</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>By the early globular (∼32-cell) stage, dcl1-null mutant embryos overexpress ∼50 miRNA targets</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>In dcl1 eight-cell embryos, the two most up-regulated targets are those of miR156 and encode SPL10 and SPL11 transcription factors</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>SPL10 and SPL11 are derepressed >150-fold in dcl1 embryos and are redundantly required for the dcl1 early patterning defects</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Moreover, as early as the eight-cell stage, miR156-mediated repression of zygotic SPL transcripts prevents premature accumulation of transcripts from genes normally induced during the embryonic maturation phase.</ABSTRACT>
