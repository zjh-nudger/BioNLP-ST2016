<ABSTRACT sid='1'>We identified gene coexpression networks in the transcriptome of developing Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds from the globular to mature embryo stages by analyzing publicly accessiblemicroarray datasets</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Genes encoding the known enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthesispathway were found in one coexpression subnetwork (or cluster), while genes encodingoleosins and seed storage proteins were identified in another subnetwork with a distinctexpression profile</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>In the triacylglycerol assembly pathway, only the genes encodingdiacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and a putative cytosolic "type 3" DGAT exhibiteda similar expression pattern with genes encoding oleosins</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>We also detected a largenumber of putative cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoter regions of these genes, and promoter motifsfor LEC1 (LEAFY COTYLEDON 1), DOF (DNA-binding-with-One-Finger), GATA, and MYB transcriptionfactors (TF), as well as SORLIP5 (Sequences Over-Represented in Light-Induced Promoters5), are overrepresented in the promoter regions of fatty acid biosynthetic genes</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>The conserved CCAAT motifs for B3-domain TFs and binding sites for bZIP (basic-leucinezipper) TFs are enriched in the promoters of genes encoding oleosins and seed storageproteins.</ABSTRACT>
