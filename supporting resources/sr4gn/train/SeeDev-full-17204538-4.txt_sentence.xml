<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Recent studies have shown that AP2 plays a global role not only in floral development but also in the control of seed mass (Jofuku et al., 1994, 2005; Okamuro et al., 1997; Ohto et al., 2005)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>In addition, AP2 expression is controlled transcriptionally and translationally in a co-ordinated manner</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>In particular, micro RNAs are thoughtto target mRNAs of AP2 and its homologs, thereby inhibiting the translation process (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003; Chen, 2004)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>However, the transcriptional regulation of AP2 has not been well understood (Okamuro et al., 1997)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>The current study showed that AP2 activity repressed AtEBP, AtERF1 and AP2 expression</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>This is consistent with previous results showing that AP2 regulates its own AP2 expression (Okamuro et al., 1997; Chen, 2004) as well as other genes, such as the ERF genes</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>In addition, over-expression of AtEBP increased the expression level of AP2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>AtEBP is a transcriptional activator interacting with GCC-box, an ethylene-responsive element (Büttner and Singh, 1997)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>Although the over-expression of AtEBP up-regulated AP2 and AtERF1 expression, these promoters (∼2·0 kb upstream from ATG) did not contain the GCC-box</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>Interestingly, analysis of tomato ERF Pti4 interacting with GCC-box revealed that Pti4 bound to promoters in the absence of GCC-box (Chakravarthy et al., 2003)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>Like Pti4, transcriptional regulation of the target genes of AtEBP may be complex</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>Down-regulation of AP2 was observed in ein2-1</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>The null mutation of EIN2 resulted in a complete loss of responsiveness to ethylene, suggesting that EIN2 is essential inthe ethylene signal pathway</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>However, AP2 expression was not induced by ethylene treatment or in ctr1-1, indicating that EIN2 is a receiver for various signals</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>It is known that EIN2 receives not only ethylene but also othersignals, such as paraquat and jasmonic acid (Alonso et al., 1999)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>The N-terminal of EIN2 is thought to be necessary for ethylene responsiveness</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>On the other hand, the C-terminal of EIN2is required for transducing the signal to the downstream components (Wang et al., 2002)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>Our observations suggested that the AP2 expression was induced via EIN2 but not by the ethylene signal (Fig. 7).</ABSTRACT>
