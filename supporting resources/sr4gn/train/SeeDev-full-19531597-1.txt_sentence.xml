<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Transcription of Arabidopsis thaliana seed maturation (MAT) genes is controlled by members of several transcription factor families, such as basic leucine zippers (bZIPs), B3s, MYBs, and DOFs</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>In this work, we identify Arabidopsis bZIP53 as a novel transcriptional regulator of MAT genes. bZIP53 expression in developing seeds precedes and overlaps that of its target genes</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>Gain- and loss-of-function approaches indicatea correlation between the amount of bZIP53 protein and MAT gene expression</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Specific in vivo and in vitro binding of bZIP53protein to a G-box element in the albumin 2S2 promoter is demonstrated</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Importantly, heterodimerization with bZIP10 or bZIP25, previously described bZIP regulators of MAT gene expression, significantly enhances DNA binding activity and produces a synergistic increase in target gene activation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Full-level target gene activation is strongly correlated with the ratio of the correspondent bZIP heterodimerization partners</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Whereas bZIP53 does not interact with ABI3, a crucial transcriptional regulator in Arabidopsis seeds, ternary complex formation between the bZIP heterodimers and ABI3 increases the expression of MAT genes in planta</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>We therefore propose that heterodimers containing bZIP53 participate in enhanceosome formation to produce a dramatic increasein MAT gene transcription.</ABSTRACT>
