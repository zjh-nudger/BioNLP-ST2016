<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Genetic and physiological studies have shown that the Arabidopsis thaliana abscisic acid-insensitive (ABI) loci interact to regulate seed-specific and/or ABA-inducible gene expression</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>We have used the yeast two-hybrid assay to determine whether any of these genetic interactions reflect direct physical interactions</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>By this criterion, only ABI3 and ABI5 physically interact with each other, and ABI5 can form homodimers</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>The B1 domain of ABI3 is essential for this interaction; this is the first specific function ascribed to this domain of the ABI3/VP1 family</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>The ABI5 domains required for interaction with ABI3 include two conserved charged domains in the amino-terminal half of the protein</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>An additional conserved charged domain appears to have intrinsic transcription activation function in this assay</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Yeast one-hybrid assays with a lacZ reporter gene under control of the late embryogenesis-abundant AtEm6 promoter show that only ABI5 binds directly to this promoter fragment.</ABSTRACT>
