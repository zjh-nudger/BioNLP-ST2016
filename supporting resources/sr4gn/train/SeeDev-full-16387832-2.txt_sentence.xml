<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Postembryonic organ formation in plants requires the maintenance of small stem cell pools in the shoot, floral, and root meristems (Weigel and Jürgens, 2002; Laux, 2003)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Similar to animal stem cell systems, the meristems provide a microenvironment, the stem cell niche, in which differentiationof the resident cells is repressed, whereas daughter cells that leave this site undergo differentiation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>In the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot meristem, the stem cells are located in the three outermost cell layers of the most central region of the shoot apex</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>The stem cells cannot be distinguished by their appearance from the surrounding meristem cells, and stem cell function canonly be unambiguously identified by clonal studies (Stewart and Dermen, 1970)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Expression of CLAVATA3 (CLV3) mRNA (Fletcher et al., 1999) that coincides with the presumed position of the apical stem cells provides an operational marker for stem cell identityin the shoot meristem</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Only a few mutants have been isolated that specifically fail to protect shoot meristem stem cells from differentiation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Oneof the genes identified from mutant studies encodes the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>WUS is expressed in a domain underneath the stem cells termed the organizing center (OC) and is required and sufficient to maintainthe overlying stem cells undifferentiated (Mayer et al., 1998; Schoof et al., 2000)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>The stem cells in turn signal back via the CLV3 peptide to restrict the size of the OC, thereby creating a negative feedbackloop to dynamically control the size of the stem cell population (Brand et al., 2000; Schoof et al., 2000)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>CLV3 presumably acts as an extracellular ligand of the CLV1 receptor kinase complex, which eventually leads to downregulationof WUS transcription in the recipient cells (Clark et al., 1997; Stone et al., 1998; Trotochaud et al., 1999; Rojo et al., 2002; Lenhard and Laux, 2003)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>In floral meristems that are homologous to indeterminate shoot meristems, the AGAMOUS (AG) gene represses WUS expression late in flower development to terminate the stem cell niche after a limited number of organs have been formed (Lenhard et al., 2001; Lohmann et al., 2001)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>The primary shoot meristem is formed during embryo development (Barton and Poethig, 1993)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>In Arabidopsis, the onset of WUS expression in precursor cells of the OC in the 16-cell embryo suggests that shoot meristem formation has been initiated alreadyat this stage (Mayer et al., 1998)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>CLV3 expression is detected from late heart stage on between the outgrowing cotyledons (Fletcher et al., 1999)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>In bent cotyledon embryos, the primary shoot meristem becomes visible as a bulge of small cytoplasmic cells that aftergermination give rise to a rosette of leaves before an inflorescence stem is formed, carrying cauline leaves with axillaryshoot meristems and bractless floral meristems</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>Many aspects of the mechanisms that operate in the stem cell niches to maintain stem cells undifferentiated are not understoodand might have escaped genetic analysis due to genetic redundancy</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>Therefore, we performed an extensive genetic screen todetect presumably rare dominant-negative mutations affecting stem cell maintenance</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>Here, we report the isolation and functionalcharacterization of the semidominant l28 mutant that in the homozygous state is unable to keep stem cells undifferentiated similar to the wus mutant</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>We show that the premature termination of the shoot meristem in l28 mutants is caused by a mutation in the APETALA2 (AP2) gene that was previously identified as one of the components of the ABC model in floral patterning, where it represses AG (Bowman et al., 1991; Drews et al., 1991), in floral transition (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997b), and in the control of seed size (Jofuku et al., 2005; Ohto et al., 2005)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>In this article, we show that maintenance of the stem cell niche in the primary shoot meristem requires the activity of AP2 and redundant factor(s) via an AG independent mechanism that involves interaction with the WUS-CLV3 feedback loop.</ABSTRACT>
