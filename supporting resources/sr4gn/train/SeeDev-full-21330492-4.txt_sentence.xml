<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The key positive regulators of the maturation program are the LEC genes, probably assisted by several bZIP and MYB transcriptionfactors (Baud et al., 2008)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>All of these bind to the promoters of seed storage protein genes and genes involved in the synthesis of storage lipids (Lara et al., 2003; Kagaya et al., 2005; Braybrook et al., 2006; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>We found that several of these genes were up-regulated in the dcl1-15 mutant: FUS3, LEC2, L1L, and several MYBs and bZIPs (Table I)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>In contrast, ABI3 was unaffected and LEC1 was down-regulated</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>We observed that in the wild type, the FUS3 and LEC2 transcriptional reporter genes are excluded from the embryo proper until the early heart stage, just before the beginningof maturation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>In dcl1-15, they are expressed in the embryo proper at least by the early globular stage, coinciding with the onset of chlorophyll accumulationin the mutant</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Our analysis of lec2-1 dcl1-15 and fus3-3 dcl1-15 double mutants confirms that both proteins are required for the early maturation phenotype, further supporting their positiondownstream of miRNAs.</ABSTRACT>
