<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The translation of AP2 mRNA is suppressed by micro RNAs (Chen, 2004) and AP2 protein down-regulates AP2 and AtEBP expression (Okamuro et al., 1997; this study), as indicated in grey</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>In the current study, it was demonstrated that AP2 expression was regulated through AtEBP and EIN2, and that AtEBP may contribute to floral development, as indicated by inblack</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>The AP2 mRNA level did not change in the ein3-1 mutant</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>The position of EIN3 is a branch of the ethylene signalling pathway under EIN2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>It is known that the sensitivityof ein3 mutants to ethylene is weaker than ein2 mutants (Wang et al., 2002)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Previous studies reported that both EIN3-dependent and independent pathways exist downstream of EIN2 (Binder et al., 2004; Seifert et al., 2004)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Furthermore, AtEBP expression is independently regulated under EIN3 in ethylene signalling (Ogawa et al., 2005; this study)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>In this study, AP2 was not induced by ethylene despite increasing expression of AtEBP</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>We suggest that these signal transductions compete with one another</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>AtEBP knockout plants exhibited a weak floral phenotype with a lower number of stamens</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>An evaluation was also made of AtERF1 and AP2 expression in AtEBP knockout plants having the same level of WT (data not shown)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>The ctr1 mutants showed an earlier-maturing phenotype in the gyneocium compared with the flower, and ein mutants affect the maturation of the gyneocium (Kieber et al., 1993)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>Interestingly, the ant mutants show a similar phenotype to the AtEBP knockout plants (Elliott et al., 1996; Klucher et al., 1996)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>ANT is a member of the AP2/ERF family containing the AP2/EREBP domains</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>Over-expression of AtEBP caused up-regulation of AP2 in leaves</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>Despite the accumulation of AP2 mRNA in transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing AtEBP, no abnormal flowers were observed</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>Chen (2004) reported that micro RNAs control transcriptional regulation of AP2 expression</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>That is, most transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing AP2 had normal flowers and only a fraction exhibited the agamous-like phenotype</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>However, over-expression of AP2 mutated at the target site of micro RNAs demonstrated a more severe floral phenotype</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>Accumulation of AP2 protein was detectedonly in transgenic plants over-expressing mutated AP2, not in normal AP2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='21'>Thus, we consider that accumulation of AP2 mRNA in Arabidopsis over-expressing AtEBP is not sufficient to change flower development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='22'>This study has shown the mutual relationships between AP2 and AtEBP</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='23'>AtEBP and functional EIN2 affected the transcriptional regulation of AP2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='24'>AtEBP contributed slightly to flower development, especially stamen development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='25'>Future reports in this series will focuson the homeotic role of AtEBP.</ABSTRACT>
