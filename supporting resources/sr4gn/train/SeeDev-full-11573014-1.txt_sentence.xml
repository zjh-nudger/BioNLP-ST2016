<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) gene is a central embryonic regulator that servescritical roles both early and late during embryo development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>LEC2 is required for the maintenance of suspensormorphology, specification of cotyledon identity, progression throughthe maturation phase, and suppression of premature germination</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>Wecloned the LEC2 gene on the basis of its chromosomalposition and showed that the predicted polypeptide contains a B3domain, a DNA-binding motif unique to plants that is characteristic ofseveral transcription factors</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>We showed that LEC2 RNAaccumulates primarily during seed development, consistent with ourfinding that LEC2 shares greatest similarity with the B3 domaintranscription factors that act primarily in developing seeds, VIVIPAROUS1/ABA INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Ectopic, postembryonicexpression of LEC2 in transgenic plants induces theformation of somatic embryos and other organ-like structures and oftenconfers embryonic characteristics to seedlings</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Together, these resultssuggest that LEC2 is a transcriptional regulator that establishes acellular environment sufficient to initiate embryo development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Embryogenesis in floweringplants begins with the double fertilization event in which the zygoteand endosperm are formed after fusion of sperm cells with the egg celland central cell of the female gametophyte, respectively</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>The endosperminitially undergoes syncytial development with formation ofnuclear-cytoplasmic domains, but later cellularizes (1)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>The developingembryo is nourished by the endosperm and, in many plants, only theperipheral layer of the endosperm remains in the mature seed</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>Development of the zygote into the mature embryo can be dividedconceptually into two distinct phases</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>During the early morphogenesisphase, the basic body plan of the plant is established with expressionof polarity as a shoot–root axis, specification of morphologicaldomains within the embryo, and formation of embryonic tissue and organsystems (2–4)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>The morphogenesis phase is followed by a period ofmaturation in which processes critical for seed formation occur (5, 6)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>During this late phase, reserves such as storage proteins and lipidsare synthesized at high rates and accumulate in the seed</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>It is alsoduring the maturation phase that the embryo acquires the ability towithstand desiccation at the final stage of seed development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>At theend of embryogenesis, the seed consists of a mature, desiccated embryothat is quiescent metabolically</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>Although many aspects of embryogenesishave been characterized extensively, little is known at a mechanisticlevel of the processes that initiate embryo development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC) genes, LEC1, LEC2, and FUSCA3 (FUS3), playkey roles in controlling embryo development (7)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>Unlike most otherembryonic regulators that function during specific stages ofembryogenesis (8–11), LEC genes are unique in that they arerequired for normal development during both the morphogenesis andmaturation phases</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>Early in embryogenesis, LEC genes arerequired to specify suspensor cell fate and cotyledon identity (12–16)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>Late in embryogenesis, LEC genes are needed duringthe maturation phase for the acquisition of desiccation tolerance andthe expression of many maturation-specific genes (13–17)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='21'>Consistentwith the finding that conditions that promote maturation suppressgermination (6), lec mutant embryos prematurely activate thepostgermination program (13, 15, 16, 18)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='22'>Thus, LEC genesplay a central role in controlling many aspects of embryogenesis, andthey are candidates as regulators that coordinate the morphogenesis andmaturation phases</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='23'>Identification and analysis of two LEC genes confirmed theirregulatory role in embryogenesis and provided insight into theirfunctions</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='24'>LEC1 shares extensive sequence similarity with the HAP3subunit of CCAAT-binding transcription factor, implicating LEC1 as atranscriptional regulator (12)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='25'>Ectopic expression of LEC1confers embryonic characteristics to seedlings and results in theformation of embryo-like structures on the surfaces of leaves,suggesting that the gene plays a role in conferring embryogeniccompetence to cells (12)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='26'>Thus, we hypothesized that LEC1 establishes acellular environment that promotes embryo development and that thisenvironment coordinates the morphogenesis and maturation phases</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='27'>FUS3 also encodes a regulatory protein: a B3 domaintranscription factor that accumulates primarily during seed development (19)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='28'>Transient assays showed that FUS3 is sufficient to activate genesusually expressed during maturation (20)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='29'>Thus, two LECgenes seem to be involved in controlling embryo development byregulating transcription of other genes</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='30'>In this article, we focus on the LEC2 gene to determine itsrole in embryo development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='31'>Because genetic studies suggest that LEC1 and LEC2 may have partially redundantfunctions (12, 15), it is possible that LEC2 also functions in theinitiation and coordination of embryo development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='32'>We cloned the LEC2 gene and showed that it is expressed preferentiallyduring embryogenesis and encodes a protein with similarity to otherseed-specific transcription factors</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='33'>Significant insight into the roleof the gene was obtained by showing that transgenic plants expressingthe LEC2 gene ectopically form somatic embryos</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='34'>Together,these results indicate that LEC2 is sufficient to induceembryogenic competence.</ABSTRACT>
