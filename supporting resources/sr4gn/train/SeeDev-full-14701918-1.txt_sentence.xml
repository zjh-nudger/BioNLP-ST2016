<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The Arabidopsis seed coat epidermis undergoes a complex process of differentiation that includes the biosynthesis and secretionof large quantities of pectinaceous mucilage, cytoplasmic rearrangement, and secondary cell wall biosynthesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Mutations in MUM4 (MUCILAGE-MODIFIED4) lead to a decrease in seed coat mucilage and incomplete cytoplasmic rearrangement</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>We show that MUM4 encodes a putative NDP-l-rhamnose synthase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of the pectin rhamnogalacturonan I, the major component of Arabidopsismucilage</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>This result suggests that the synthesis of monosaccharide substrates is a limiting factor in the biosynthesis ofpectinaceous seed coat mucilage</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>In addition, the reduced cytoplasmic rearrangement observed in the absence of a key enzymein pectin biosynthesis in mum4 mutants establishes a causal link between mucilage production and cellular morphogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>The cellular phenotype seen inmum4 mutants is similar to that of several transcription factors (AP2 [APETALA2], TTG1 [TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1], TTG2 MYB61, and GL2 [GLABRA2])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Expression studies suggest that MUM4 is developmentally regulated in the seed coat by AP2, TTG1, and GL2, whereas TTG2 and MYB61 appear to be regulating mucilage production through alternate pathway(s)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>Our results provide a framework for the regulationof mucilage production and secretory cell differentiation.</ABSTRACT>
