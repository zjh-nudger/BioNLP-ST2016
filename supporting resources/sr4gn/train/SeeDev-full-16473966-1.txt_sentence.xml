<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Arabidopsis thaliana SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (SERK1) is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) involved in theacquisition of embryogenic competence and in male sporogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>To determine the composition of the SERK1 signaling complexin vivo, we generated plants expressing the SERK1 protein fused to cyan fluorescent protein under SERK1 promoter control</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>The membrane receptor complex was immunoprecipitated from seedlings, and the coimmunoprecipitating proteins were identifiedusing liquid chromatography/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight/mass spectrometry of the trypsin-releasedpeptides</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>This approach identified two other LRR-RLKs, the BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) receptor and its coreceptor,the SERK3 or BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 protein</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>In addition, KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, CDC48A, and 14-3-3ν werefound</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Finally, the MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein, a memberof the CONSTANS family, were identified as part of the SERK1 complex</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we show that SERK1 and SERK3 are part of BRI1-containing multiple protein complexes with relative masses between 300 and 500 kD</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>The SERK1mutant allele serk1-1 enhances the phenotype of the weak BRI1 allele bri1-119</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>Collectively, these results suggest that apart from SERK3, SERK1 is also involved in the brassinolide signaling pathway.</ABSTRACT>
