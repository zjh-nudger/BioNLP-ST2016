<ABSTRACT sid='1'>LEC2 Possesses a B3 Domain Characteristic of Transcription Factors</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Our findings that the LEC2 gene encodes a B3 domain protein (Fig. 3) and is expressed primarily during embryogenesis (Fig. 4)suggest that it, like LEC1 and FUS3, is a transcriptional regulator ofseed development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>The B3 domain is an â‰ˆ120-amino acid residue regiondefined originally as the third basic region of maize VP1, which sharesthe largest contiguous block of sequence identity with its ortholog, Arabidopsis ABI3 (10)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Subsequently, this domain wasidentified in other plant proteins, such as AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR1 (34)and RELATED TO ABI3/VP1 (32)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Many proteins containing B3 domains,including ABI3/VP1, FUS3, and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR1, function astranscription factors (20, 33, 34)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>The B3 domain is responsible, atleast in part, for the DNA-binding activity of ABI3/VP1 and RELATED TO ABI3/VP1 (32, 37, 38)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>To our knowledge, the B3 DNA-binding domainis unique to plants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>Maximum parsimony analysis (39) of the B3 domains of 48 predicted Arabidopsis proteins suggests that LEC2, FUS3, and ABI3constitute one class, perhaps indicating their common origin (S.L.S.and J.J.H., unpublished results)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>All three genes are expressedprimarily during embryogenesis and are required genetically for thecompletion of normal seed development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>Although they all play roles inseed development, their specific functions have diverged</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>ABI3 is atranscription factor that operates primarily during the maturationphase, whereas LEC2 and FUS3 are LEAFY COTYLEDON proteins required forprocesses during both the morphogenesis and maturation phases.</ABSTRACT>
