<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Seeds of higher plants consist of three major components, each with a different genotype</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>The embryo that develops into thevegetative plant is diploid with a zygotic complement of genomes contributed by its parents</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>The endosperm, a tissue systemthat serves a nutritive role for the developing embryo and/or germinating seedling, is triploid with two and one genome equivalents,respectively, contributed by the maternal and paternal parent</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>By contrast, the seed coat that surrounds the embryo and endospermis strictly of maternal origin</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Growth and development of the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat must be coordinated to producethe mature seed</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Although seeds have been studied extensively, many aspects of seed development are not well understood, includingthe mechanisms that underlie seed size or mass</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>A critical factor in determining plant fitness is seed mass</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>Seed mass is negatively correlated with the number of seeds producedand positively correlated with seedling survival (1–5)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>Small-seeded plants are considered to be efficient colonizers because they produce large numbers of seeds, whereas seedlingsof large-seeded plants are thought to more effectively withstand resource restrictions and abiotic stresses</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>Moreover, seedmass can vary intraspecifically in response to environmental cues, although little is known of the specific regulatory processesinvolved</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>Several factors that influence seed mass have been identified</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>For example, quantitative trait loci (QTL) that influence seedmass have been mapped in a number of crop plants (6–12)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>An analysis of genetic factors affecting Arabidopsis seed mass used a segregating population from a cross between small-seeded and large-seeded ecotypes to show that both maternaland nonmaternal QTL affect seed mass, implicating both the maternal and zygotic genomes in processes that determine the sizesof seeds (13)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>Although the specific genes associated with these QTL have not been identified, other studies implicate enzymes involvedin sugar metabolism as candidates for factors that influence seed mass (14)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>A series of studies with fava bean suggest that the relative accumulation of hexose and sucrose during seed developmentplays roles in determining seed mass through changes in seed cell number and cell size (14–16)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>Seed mass is also influenced by parent-of-origin effects (17, 18)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>Interploidy crosses between diploid and polyploid plants produce offspring with a maternal or paternal genomic excess</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>Seeds from Arabidopsis plants with a paternal genomic excess are larger than diploid seeds resulting from self-fertilization, whereas smaller seedsare obtained with a maternal genomic excess</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>The parental conflict theory (19, 20), proposed to account for these parent-of-origin effects, posits that the maternal plant will attempt to allocate resourcesequally among its progeny, whereas the paternal plant will try to maximize channeling of maternal resources to its progeny</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>Imprinting of maternal and paternal alleles expressed in the endosperm has been implicated to function in the control of seedmass (reviewed in refs. 21–23)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='21'>In this study, we focus on the role of Arabidopsis APETALA2 (AP2) in controlling seed mass</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='22'>AP2 encodes the founding member of a family of plant-specific transcription factors that contains an AP2/EREBP (ethylene responsiveelement binding protein) domain, a conserved region of ≈60 aa involved in DNA binding (24–26)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='23'>This transcription factor is involved in the specification of flower organ identity, establishment of flower meristem identity,and suppression of flower meristem indeterminancy (25, 27–31)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='24'>AP2 is also required for ovule and seed coat development (24, 32, 33)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='25'>Although the most conspicuous function of AP2 is in flower development, its transcripts are not restricted to flowers but are detected in leaves, stems, and seedlingsalso (24, 34), opening the possibility of a more global function for AP2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='26'>Here, we identify a previously undescribed function for AP2 by showing that loss-of-function ap2 mutations cause increases in seed mass.</ABSTRACT>
