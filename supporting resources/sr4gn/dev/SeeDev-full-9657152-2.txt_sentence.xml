<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Higherplant embryogenesis is divided conceptually into two distinct phases:early morphogenetic processes that give rise to embryonic cell types,tissues, and organ systems, and late maturation events that allow thefully developed embryo to enter a desiccated and metabolically quiescentstate ([52] and [13])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Upon reception of the appropriate signals, the dormant embryogerminates, and seedling development begins</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>Thus, seed maturation andmetabolic quiescence interrupt the morphogenetic processes that occurduring embryogenesis and seedling development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>This unique form ofdevelopment underlies, in part, a plant's ability to make seeds, a traitthat has conferred significant selective advantages to higher plants (Steeves 1983)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Because lower plants do not make seeds and do not undergo embryomaturation, this bipartite mode of embryogenesis is thought to haveresulted from the insertion of maturation events into the higher plantlife cycle (reviewed by[51],[47] and [16])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Little is known at the mechanistic level about how distinct processesthat occur during the morphogenesis and seed maturation phases arecoordinated.Genetic strategies employed to identify regulators of Arabidopsis thaliana embryo development have distinguished several gene classes that affect embryogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>One class of mutations, including raspberry, tinman, and abnormal suspensor ([41],[56],[7] and [49]; T. L. et al, unpublished data), causes the arrest of embryomorphogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>Many of the corresponding proteins are involved in basiccellular functions and probably do not perform direct regulatory roles</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>Asecond class of genes predicted to play a role in embryonic patternformation has been identified (Mayer et al. 1991)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>The expression patterns of two such genes, EMB30 (GNOM) and KNOLLE, suggest that they do not function specifically during embryogenesis ([42] and [23])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>Another class, including SHOOTMERISTEMLESS and SCARECROW, is active in the developing shoot or root apical meristems ([9] and [22])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>Although these genes play key roles in meristem function, they arerequired for meristem formation during both embryogenesis andpostembryonic development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), a fourth gene class, encodes an embryo-specific transcription factor that regulates genes expressed during seed maturation ([20] and [38])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>However, its function is limited to the late stages of embryogenesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>Although each of these gene classes is essential for embryo development,none appears to act specifically during embryogenesis to control boththe morphogenesis and maturation phases.The LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) gene, by contrast, controls many distinct aspects of embryogenesis (Meinke 1992Meinke, 1992, 1994;[53] and [39])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>As summarized in Figure 1, the lec1 mutation is pleiotropic, indicating several roles in late embryo development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>LEC1 is required for specific aspects of seed maturation. lec1mutant embryos are intolerant of desiccation and show defects in theexpression of some, but not all, maturation-specific genes ([28],[53] and [39])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>LEC1 is also involved in inhibiting premature germination. lec1mutant embryos exhibit morphological and molecular characteristics ofboth embryogenesis and postgerminative seedling development, showingthat aspects of both programs can occur simultaneously (Meinke 1992Meinke, 1992, 1994; West et al. 1994)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>LEC1 plays a role in the specification of embryonic organ identity as well</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>Embryonic leaves or cotyledons of lec1 mutants possess trichomes, epidermal hairs, which normally form only on leaves and stems in Arabidopsis ([28] and [53])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='21'>The anatomy of lec1 mutant cotyledons is intermediate between those of a wild-type cotyledon and a leaf (West et al. 1994)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='22'>Finally, LEC1 appears to act only during embryo development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='23'>Desiccation-intolerant lec1embryos can be rescued from plants before desiccation and germinated toproduce homozygous mutant plants that are fertile and that do notdisplay any obvious vegetative or floral mutant phenotypes ([28] and [53])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='24'>Two other LEC class genes, LEC2 and FUSCA3 (FUS3), are thought to share similar or overlapping functions with LEC1, including the specification or cotyledon identity and the maintenance of maturation ([2],[18] and [29])</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='25'>Although nothing has been reported about how LECclass genes act at the molecular level, their involvement in manydiverse aspects of embryogenesis suggests that these genes serve asregulators of higher plant embryonic processes.Figure 1. Pleiotropic Effects of the lec1 Mutation on Embryo DevelopmentMajor differences between wild-type and lec1mutant embryos are as follows</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='26'>Embryo shape: the axes of mutant embryosare short, and their cotyledons are round and do not curl</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='27'>Anthocyaningenerally accumulates at the tips of mutant cotyledons</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='28'>Precociousgermination: the shoot apical meristems of lec1 embryos areactivated in that they are domed and possess leaf primordia, unliketheir wild-type counterparts that are flat and do not contain leafprimordia</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='29'>Defects in seed maturation: lec1 mutant embryos are intolerant of desiccation and normally die if dried on the plant</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='30'>However, lec1embryos isolated before desiccation can be germinated to producefertile homozygous mutant plants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='31'>The promoter of a 7S storage proteingene that is normally active during wild-type embryogenesis is notactive in the lec1 mutant</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='32'>Incomplete specification of cotyledon identity: lec1 seedlings possess trichomes on cotyledons</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='33'>Trichomes are present on Arabidopsis leaves and stems but not on wild-type cotyledons. a, axis; c, cotyledon; SAM, shoot apical meristem.View thumbnail imagesView high quality image (116K)In this paper, we report the isolation of the LEC1 gene and show that it encodes a homolog of a conserved eukaryotic transcription factor</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='34'>Expression studies showed that the LEC1 gene is active only within seeds during both early and late seed development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='35'>Ectopic expression of the LEC1gene induces embryonic programs and embryo development in vegetativecells</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='36'>We suggest that LEC1 is an important transcriptional regulatorrequired for both early and late embryogenesis that controls andcoordinates higher plant embryo development.</ABSTRACT>
