<ABSTRACT sid='1'>In contrast,plants that overexpress floral MADS factors, such as AP1, AG, or AP3 with PISTILLATA, typically have a shorter vegetativephase than do wild-type plants, resulting in fewer rosette leaves and earlier flowering (reviewed in Ma 1998)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Given the accumulation pattern of AGL15 in wild-type plants, AGL15 might act by prolonging or promoting the early juvenilephase in the transgenic plants; that is, it may "juvenilize" the plants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>Effects at the beginning of the juvenile phase wouldtranslate into a delay in flowering because competence to flower is acquired in an age-dependent fashion (Thomas 1993)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>A partially juvenilized plant might require a longer period or stronger inductive signals before flowering</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>The petioles of the cotyledons and rosette leaves were considerably shorter and the leaf blades were shorter and rounder inplants carrying AGL15 transgenes</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>In wild-type Arabidopsis, rounded leaves are produced during the earliest stages of vegetative growth, whereasincreasingly spatulate leaves are produced later (Bowman 1994 ; Poethig 1997)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Although the change in leaf shape suggests a more juvenile mode of morphogenesis in the transgenic plants, leaf shape istoo variable and the regulation of leaf shape is too complex (reviewed in Poethig 1997) for this character to serve as a definitive marker of phase</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>In Arabidopsis, a more consistent marker of the juvenile phaseis the absence of trichomes on the abaxial surface of the leaf (Telfer et al. 1997).</ABSTRACT>
