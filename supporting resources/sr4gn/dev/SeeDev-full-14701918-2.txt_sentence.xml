<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The mature seed coat, in addition to forming a protective layer around the embryo, can play roles in such processes as seeddispersal and germination</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>One adaptation believed to act in these processes is the production of mucilage in the epidermalcells of the seed coat</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>This specialization, known as myxospermy, is found in many families, including the Brassicaceae, Solanaceae, Linaceae, and Plantaginaceae (Grubert, 1981; Boesewinkel and Bouman, 1995)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Seed imbibition in these plants leads to the formation of a gel capsule around the seed that is thought to aid hydrationand/or dispersal.</ABSTRACT>
