<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Although the defect in mucilage production is readily explained by the putativefunction of MUM4 as an NDP-l-Rha synthase, the connection with the columella shape change is less obvious</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>At least two hypotheses can explain the dependenceof cell morphogenesis on mucilage synthesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>The formation of the apoplastic space and cytoplasmic column may be driven bythe pressure of accumulating mucilage in the extracytoplasmic space and/or the formation of an osmotic gradient between thecell and the hydrophilic pectin may lead to the loss of turgor and size reduction of the vacuole</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Such passive processes maycontribute to cell morphogenesis but seem too simple to account for the apparent complexity of the shape of the cytoplasmiccolumn</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>An alternate but not mutually exclusive explanation is that the synthesis of mucilage may represent or lead to theproduction of an oligosaccharide signal that stimulates the cell to undergo morphogenesis (Dumville and Fry, 2000; Ridley et al., 2001)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Determination of the exact processes involved would be facilitated by the isolation of mutants affected specifically inthe shaping of the columella.</ABSTRACT>
