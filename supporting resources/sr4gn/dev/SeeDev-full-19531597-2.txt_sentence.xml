<ABSTRACT sid='1'>As an outstanding adaptation of terrestrial plants, seed formation favors dispersal of species and allows the interruptionof the life cycle and its resumption once optimal growth conditions are newly established (for review, see Vicente-Carbajosaand Carbonero, 2005; Weber et al., 2005; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Seeds are formed after a double fertilization event, triggering the development of a complex organ, which comprises theembryo, the endosperm, and the seed coat derived from the integuments and other surrounding layers of maternal origin</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>Seeddevelopment can be divided into three phases: first, embryogenesis is characterized by cell division and differentiation untilembryo morphology is established</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Second, the maturation phase is dominated by storage compound accumulation, growth arrest,and acquisition of desiccation tolerance</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Third, the embryo can enter into a dormancy state that is broken upon germination</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>With respect to seed morphology, physiology, and gene regulation, considerable variations occur among species</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Arabidopsis thaliana has been developed as a well-established model system for dicot seed development, and several similarities and differenceswith monocot model systems have been described (Vicente-Carbajosa and Carbonero, 2005; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>Important programs of gene expression related to the metabolic changes that occur during seed maturation are highly coordinatedand tightly regulated (Gutierrez et al., 2007)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>An understanding of gene expression control in the seed was tackled from early studies in plant molecular biology, withmaize (Zea mays) Opaque2 (O2) representing a hallmark as one of the first plant transcription factor (TF) genes cloned and characterized (Hartings et al., 1989; Schmidt et al., 1990)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>Similarly, orthologous genes from wheat (Triticum aestivum) (SPA) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) (BLZ2) play the same roles as O2 in their corresponding species (Albani et al., 1997; OÃ±ate et al., 1999)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>In dicot species, key TFs have been characterized that control gene expression programs during seed maturation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>The class of maturation genes (MAT) expressed during seed maturation typically includes seed storage protein (SSP) genes,such as albumin and cruciferin genes, which are induced in early or mid-maturation phase</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>The late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) genes are induced at later stages of maturation and include genes proposed to be involved in acquisition of desiccationtolerance (for review, see Tunnacliffe and Wise, 2007)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>MAT promoter analyses have revealed several conserved cis-regulatory elements with functional relevance in the control of gene expression during seed maturation</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>Among them, G-box-related ACGT elements, RY (CATGCA), AACA, and CTTT motifs are the best described examples (for review, see Vicente-Carbajosa and Carbonero,2005)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>The corresponding associated TFs belong to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP), B3, MYB, and DOF TF families, respectively</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>Cooperation of these regulatory units in the control of gene expression appears to be an evolutionarily conserved patternthat can be traced back to the origins of the Spermaphyta (Vicente-Carbajosa and Carbonero, 2005; Schallau et al., 2008)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>TFs of the bZIP class, related to cereal O2-type TFs, have been identified in Arabidopsis (Lara et al., 2003), namely, bZIP10 and bZIP25, which have been classified into group C of the Arabidopsis bZIP TF family (Jakoby et al., 2002)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>Expression during seed development, specific binding to G-box-like ACGT elements of the albumin and cruciferin promoters,and in vivo regulation of these target genes have been demonstrated (Lara et al., 2003).</ABSTRACT>
