<ABSTRACT sid='1'>Developmental Regulation of MUM4 during Seed Coat Secretory Cell Differentiation by AP2, TTG1, and GL2 MUM4 transcript increases in differentiating siliques at the time of mucilage production</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>Two lines of evidence suggest that thisup-regulation occurs in the seed coat epidermis to support mucilage biosynthesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>First, the only obvious phenotypic defectin mum4 plants occurs in the seed coat epidermis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Second, MUM4 expression is severely attenuated in siliques of ap2 mutants that fail to differentiate the outer two layers of the seed coat</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>Such a specific up-regulation of a putative NDP-l-Rha synthase may be required to provide extra Rha for the production of the large quantity of RGI required for mucilage synthesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>If so, the amount of this enzyme must be the limiting factor in Rha biosynthesis and the amount of Rha a limiting factor in RGI biosynthesis</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>Our data indicate that MUM4 transcription is decreased in ttg1 and gl2 mutants but is essentially wild type in ttg2 and myb61 mutants (Fig. 7A)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>This result suggests a regulatory framework for mucilage secretory cell differentiation in which there are at least twopathways controlling mucilage biosynthesis in the seed coat</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>In one of these pathways, it appears that TTG1 and GL2 controlthe transcription of MUM4 (Fig. 8)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>In other epidermal systems, such as trichomes and root hairs, TTG1 has been shown to interact with a tissue-specific MYBprotein through the bHLH protein GLABRA3 (Payne et al., 2000; Schiefelbein, 2003) to activate GL2</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>Therefore, we favor a model in which a seed coat-specific complex of TTG1-bHLH-MYB causes activation of GL2 and the subsequent up-regulation of MUM4 during mucilage production (Fig. 8)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>Recent results suggest that EGL3 (ENHANCER OF GLABRA3) and/or TT8 (TRANSPARENT TESTA8) are the bHLH proteins acting with TTG1 in the seed coat (Zhang et al., 2003).</ABSTRACT>
