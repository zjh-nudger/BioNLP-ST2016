<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The pleiotropic effects of lec mutations, representedin Fig. 1, suggest that the LEC genes serve as centralregulators of embryo and seed development</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>This prediction wasconfirmed by showing that LEC1 and FUS3 encodeputative transcription factors that regulate critical embryonicprocesses (12, 19, 20)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>Here we present evidence suggesting that LEC2 likely encodes a transcriptional regulator with asignificant role in embryogenesis.</ABSTRACT>
