<ABSTRACT sid='1'>The late stages of embryogenesis in higher plants are dominated by seed formation during which vegetative growth of the embryo is halted and storage reserves are accumulated</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>In addition, the embryo develops desiccation tolerance to prevent damage by the loss of water at the end of ripening (Goldberg et al. 1994 ;Hughes & Galau 1989;Jürgens & Mayer 1994;West & Harada 1993)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>By means of seed formation, the plant embryo acquires a quiescent and protected state which allows it to outlast unfavourable environmental conditions such as drought</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>Under more suitable circumstances, germination can be initiated and further postembryonic vegetative development commences</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>In Arabidopsis thaliana, recessive mutations in the FUSCA3 gene (FUS3) lead to a complex phenotype specifically affecting seed formation (Bäumlein et al. 1994 ;Keith et al. 1994)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>Particularly, fus3 embryos are defective in producing 12S and 2S seed proteins as well as storage lipids but accumulate large amounts of anthocyanin.</ABSTRACT>
