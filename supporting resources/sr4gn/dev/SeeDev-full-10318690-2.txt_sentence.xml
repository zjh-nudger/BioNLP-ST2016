<ABSTRACT sid='1'>We reported previously that AGL15 accumulated at its highest levels in the products of double fertilization (the embryo, suspensor,and endosperm) following sexual reproduction in angiosperms and was maintained at high levels in immature embryos (Perry et al., 1996)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='2'>If AGL15 is important for development in an embryonic mode, as this pattern of accumulation might suggest, we would alsoexpect to find relatively high levels of AGL15 or AGL15-related proteins in developmental contexts where embryos or organswith embryonic tissue arise outside of the seed or by means other than fertilization of the egg</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='3'>We have used AGL15-specificantibodies to examine developmental situations of this type in a variety of flowering plants</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='4'>In every case, whenever embryosor embryonic organs were present, relatively high levels of AGL15-related proteins could be detected as well</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='5'>The results of our study of dandelion embryos indicate that the absence of a fertilization event does not preclude accumulationof AGL15</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='6'>In dandelion, embryos arise via apomixis, which is a form of asexual reproduction</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='7'>AGL15-related protein accumulatesin the same pattern in these asexual embryos as it does in zygotic embryos that arise following a fertilization event (Perry et al., 1996)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='8'>The results of our study of the xtc2 mutant of Arabidopsis indicate that AGL15 accumulates in organs with embryonic features (i.e. cotyledons) even if they initiateduring later stages of embryogeny and develop largely after germination</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='9'>In the xtc2 mutant of Arabidopsis, secondary cotyledons appear as a result of changes in the relative timing of embryo and shoot apexdevelopment (Conway and Poethig, 1997). xtc2 embryo development is delayed, but shoot apex development initiates precociously</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='10'>Maturation-stagextc2 embryos are at the late-heart to early-torpedo stage of development in terms of morphogenesis but have large primordia atthe shoot apex (Conway and Poethig, 1997)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='11'>We found that AGL15 accumulated to higher levels in the secondary cotyledons that developed from these primordia than inleaves of the same age</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='12'>The results of our study of organs produced during precocious germination in oilseed rape indicate that AGL15 also accumulatesin cotyledons that are initiated outside of the seed environment</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='13'>When immature oilseed rape embryos were excised and placedinto culture, they produced three different kinds of organs: secondary cotyledons, leaves, and chimeric organs, with largesectors of cotyledon and leaf tissue (Finkelstein and Crouch, 1984; Fernandez, 1997)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='14'>The amount of AGL15 present in these organs was directly proportional to the amount of cotyledon tissue present, despitethe fact that these organs initiated after the maternal tissues were removed and often after an extended period in culture</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='15'>Finally, the results of our studies of somatic embryogenesis indicate that AGL15 accumulates even when embryos arise de novofrom cells in other phases of the life cycle</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='16'>Immature oilseed rape microspores can be induced to develop into pollen, calli,or embryos</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='17'>AGL15 was undetectable in the nuclei of fully mature pollen and in the cells in unorganized masses</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='18'>Only the cellsthat took on an embryonic identity accumulated higher levels of AGL15</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='19'>The accumulation pattern of AGL15-related proteinswas even more interesting in alfalfa, where embryos were obtained by culturing mature leaf tissue</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='20'>Immunoreactive proteinwas present at relatively high levels in the leaf mesophyll cells of alfalfa</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='21'>Detectable amounts of AGL15-related proteins did not accumulate in the mature leaf tissues of oilseed rape, Arabidopsis (Heck et al., 1995;Perry et al., 1996; and S.E. Perry, personal observation), tomato (M.D. Lehti, personal observation), or maize (S.-C. Fang, personal observation);however, they did accumulate in the mature leaf tissues of pea, another legume (M.D. Lehti, personal observation)</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='22'>Does theaccumulation of AGL15-related protein at high levels somehow enhance the embryogenic potential of alfalfa leaf cells? AGL15accumulation did not appear to be sufficient to confer an embryonic identity on a cell or cells: the floral organs of plantsoverexpressing AGL15 accumulated AGL15 (Fig. 1c) but maintained their identity as reproductive tissues</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='23'>However, AGL15 may be necessary to either direct or support developmentin an embryonic mode</ABSTRACT>
<ABSTRACT sid='24'>The fact that immature oilseed rape microspores accumulated low but detectable amounts of AGL15 andalso had embryogenic potential that can be expressed in culture may be significant in this regard.</ABSTRACT>
